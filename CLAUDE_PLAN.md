# CORE CONTEXT (Essential)

## Session Prologue (Short)

1. **Follow LEAD‚ÜíPLAN‚ÜíEXEC** - Target ‚â•85% gate pass rate
2. **Use sub-agents** - Architect, QA, Reviewer - summarize outputs
3. **Database-first** - No markdown files as source of truth
4. **USE PROCESS SCRIPTS** - ‚ö†Ô∏è NEVER bypass add-prd-to-database.js, unified-handoff-system.js ‚ö†Ô∏è
5. **Small PRs** - Target ‚â§100 lines, max 400 with justification
6. **Priority-first** - Use `npm run prio:top3` to justify work

*For copy-paste version: see `templates/session-prologue.md` (generate via `npm run session:prologue`)*

## üèóÔ∏è Application Architecture - CRITICAL CONTEXT

### Two Distinct Applications:
1. **EHG_Engineer** (Management Dashboard) - WHERE YOU ARE NOW
   - **Path**: `/mnt/c/_EHG/EHG_Engineer/`
   - **Purpose**: LEO Protocol dashboard for managing Strategic Directives & PRDs
   - **Database**: dedlbzhpgkmetvhbkyzq (Supabase)
   - **GitHub**: https://github.com/rickfelix/EHG_Engineer.git
   - **Port**: 3000-3001
   - **Role**: MANAGEMENT TOOL ONLY - no customer features here!

2. **EHG** (Business Application) - IMPLEMENTATION TARGET
   - **Path**: `/mnt/c/_EHG/ehg/`
   - **Purpose**: The actual customer-facing business application
   - **Database**: liapbndqlqxdcgpwntbv (Supabase)
   - **GitHub**: https://github.com/rickfelix/ehg.git
   - **Built with**: Vite + React + Shadcn + TypeScript
   - **Role**: WHERE ALL FEATURES GET IMPLEMENTED

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: During EXEC Phase Implementation
1. **Read PRD** from EHG_Engineer database
2. **Navigate** to `/mnt/c/_EHG/ehg/` for implementation
3. **Make code changes** in EHG application (NOT in EHG_Engineer!)
4. **Push changes** to EHG's GitHub repo: `rickfelix/ehg.git`
5. **Track progress** in EHG_Engineer dashboard

### üîÑ Workflow Relationship
```
EHG_Engineer (Management)          EHG App (Implementation)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Strategic Directives     ‚Üí     Features implemented here
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PRDs                     ‚Üí     Code changes made here
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Progress Tracking        ‚Üê     Results verified from here
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Dashboard Views          ‚Üê     No changes here!
```

## Execution Philosophy

## üß† EXECUTION PHILOSOPHY (Read First!)

These principles override default behavior and must be internalized before starting work:

### Quality-First (PARAMOUNT)
**Get it right, not fast.** Correctness and completeness are MORE IMPORTANT than speed.
- Take the time needed to understand requirements fully
- Verify BEFORE implementing, test BEFORE claiming completion
- 2-4 hours of careful implementation beats 6-12 hours of rework
- If rushing leads to mistakes, you haven't saved time - you've wasted it
- "Done right" > "Done fast" - ALWAYS

### Testing-First (MANDATORY)
**Build confidence through comprehensive testing.**
- E2E testing is MANDATORY, not optional
- 30-60 minute investment saves 4-6 hours of rework
- 100% user story coverage required
- Both unit tests AND E2E tests must pass
- Tests are not overhead - they ARE the work

### Database-First (REQUIRED)
**Zero markdown files.** Database tables are single source of truth.
- SDs ‚Üí `strategic_directives_v2`
- PRDs ‚Üí `product_requirements_v2`
- Handoffs ‚Üí `sd_phase_handoffs`
- Retrospectives ‚Üí `retrospectives`
- Sub-agent results ‚Üí `sub_agent_execution_results`

### Validation-First (GATEKEEPING)
**Thorough validation BEFORE approval, full commitment AFTER.**
- LEAD validates: Real problem? Feasible solution? Resources available?
- After LEAD approval: SCOPE LOCK - deliver what was approved
- Exception: Critical blocker + human approval + new SD for deferred work

### Context-Aware (PROACTIVE)
**Monitor token usage proactively throughout execution.**
- Report context health in EVERY handoff
- HEALTHY (<70%), WARNING (70-90%), CRITICAL (90-95%), EMERGENCY (>95%)
- Use `/context-compact` when approaching WARNING threshold

### Application-Aware (VERIFICATION)
**Verify directory BEFORE writing ANY code.**
- `cd /mnt/c/_EHG/ehg && pwd` for customer features
- `git remote -v` to confirm correct repository
- Wrong directory = STOP immediately

### Evidence-Based (PROOF REQUIRED)
**Screenshot, test, verify. Claims without evidence are rejected.**
- Screenshot BEFORE and AFTER changes
- Test results with pass/fail counts
- CI/CD pipeline status (green checks required)
- Sub-agent verification results in database

**REMEMBER**: The goal is NOT to complete SDs quickly. The goal is to complete SDs CORRECTLY. A properly implemented SD that takes 8 hours is infinitely better than a rushed implementation that takes 4 hours but requires 6 hours of fixes.


## üîÑ Git Commit Guidelines

**Git Commit Guidelines**: `<type>(<SD-ID>): <subject>` format MANDATORY

**Required**: Type (feat/fix/docs/etc), SD-ID scope, imperative subject, AI attribution in footer
**Timing**: After checklist items, before context switches, at logical breakpoints
**Branch Strategy**: `eng/` prefix for EHG_Engineer, standard prefixes for EHG app features
**Size**: <100 lines ideal, <200 max

**Full Guidelines**: See `docs/03_protocols_and_standards/leo_git_commit_guidelines_v4.2.0.md`

## Database Operations - One Table at a Time

### REQUIRED: Database Operations Only

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: One Table at a Time**
- When manipulating Supabase tables, **ALWAYS operate on ONE table at a time**
- Batch operations across multiple tables often fail or cause inconsistencies
- Complete each table operation fully before moving to the next table
- Verify success after each table operation before proceeding

**Strategic Directives**:
- ‚úÖ Create in `strategic_directives_v2` table
- ‚úÖ Use `scripts/create-strategic-directive.js` or dashboard
- ‚úÖ ALL SD data must be in database, not files
- ‚úÖ **One SD insertion at a time** - verify before next

**PRDs (Product Requirements)**:
- ‚úÖ Create in `product_requirements_v2` table
- ‚úÖ Use `scripts/add-prd-to-database.js`
- ‚úÖ Link to SD via `strategic_directive_id` foreign key
- ‚úÖ **One PRD insertion at a time** - verify before next

**Retrospectives**:
- ‚úÖ Create in `retrospectives` table
- ‚úÖ Use `scripts/generate-comprehensive-retrospective.js`
- ‚úÖ Trigger: Continuous Improvement Coach sub-agent
- ‚úÖ Link to SD via `sd_id` foreign key
- ‚úÖ **One retrospective at a time** - verify before next

**Handoffs**:
- ‚úÖ Store in handoff tracking tables
- ‚úÖ 7-element structure required
- ‚úÖ Link to SD and phase
- ‚úÖ **One handoff at a time** - verify before next

**Progress & Verification**:
- ‚úÖ Update database fields directly
- ‚úÖ Store verification results in database
- ‚úÖ Track in real-time via dashboard
- ‚úÖ **One record update at a time** - verify before next

## üìä Communication & Context

### Communication Style

**Brief by Default**: Responses should be concise and action-oriented unless the user explicitly requests detailed explanations.

**When to be Brief** (default):
- Status updates and progress reports
- Acknowledging commands or requests
- Confirming successful operations
- Error messages (summary + fix)
- Tool invocation descriptions

**When to be Verbose** (only if requested):
- User asks "explain in detail"
- User requests "comprehensive" or "thorough" analysis
- Teaching or knowledge transfer scenarios
- Complex debugging requiring full context
- Documentation generation

**Examples**:

| Context | ‚ùå Verbose (unnecessary) | ‚úÖ Brief (preferred) |
|---------|------------------------|---------------------|
| File created | "I have successfully created the file at the specified path with all the requested content..." | "File created: path/to/file.md" |
| Test passed | "The test suite has been executed and all tests have passed successfully with 100% coverage..." | "‚úÖ Tests passed (100% coverage)" |
| Next step | "Now I will proceed to the next step which involves updating the database schema..." | "Updating database schema..." |

### Context Economy Rules

**Core Principles**:
- **Response Budget**: ‚â§500 tokens default (unless complexity requires more)
- **Summarize > Paste**: Reference paths/links instead of full content
- **Fetch-on-Demand**: Name files first, retrieve only needed parts
- **Running Summaries**: Keep condensed handoff/PR descriptions

### Best Practices

**Efficient Context Usage**:
- **Quote selectively**: Show only relevant lines with context
- **Use file:line references**: `src/component.js:42-58` instead of full file
- **Batch related reads**: Minimize round-trips when exploring
- **Archive verbosity**: Move details to handoffs/database, not conversation

### Examples

| ‚ùå Inefficient | ‚úÖ Efficient |
|----------------|--------------|
| Paste entire 500-line file | Quote lines 42-58 with `...` markers |
| Read file multiple times | Batch read relevant sections once |
| Repeat full error in response | Summarize error + reference line |
| Include all test output | Show failed tests + counts only |

### üîÑ MANDATORY: Server Restart Protocol
After ANY code changes:
1. **Kill the dev server**: `kill [PID]` or Ctrl+C
2. **Restart the server**: `npm run dev` or appropriate command
3. **Wait for ready message**: Confirm server is fully started
4. **Hard refresh browser**: Ctrl+Shift+R / Cmd+Shift+R
5. **Verify changes are live**: Test the new functionality

**WHY**: Dev servers may cache components, especially new files. Hot reload is NOT always reliable.

## Parallel Execution

**When to Use**: Modern AI supports parallel tool execution for independent operations. Use conservatively.

**Safe for Parallel Execution**:
- ‚úÖ Reading multiple independent files for analysis
- ‚úÖ Running multiple independent database queries
- ‚úÖ Executing multiple read-only Git commands (status, log, diff)
- ‚úÖ Multiple WebFetch calls to different URLs
- ‚úÖ Batch file searches (multiple Glob operations)

**NOT Safe for Parallel Execution**:
- ‚ùå Write operations (Edit, Write tools)
- ‚ùå Database mutations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- ‚ùå Any operations where order matters
- ‚ùå Operations that depend on each other's results
- ‚ùå Git operations that modify state (commit, push, merge)

**Critical Constraint**: Context sharing between parallel operations is limited. Each operation receives the same initial context but cannot see other parallel operations' results until they all complete.

**Example Use Case**:
```
"Read the following 3 files for analysis:"
- Read src/component.tsx
- Read src/types.ts
- Read tests/component.test.tsx
```

**Anti-Pattern**:
```
"Read file A, then based on what you find, read file B"
(Must be sequential - second read depends on first)
```

## Quick Reference

## üìã QUICK REFERENCE

### Component Sizing

| Lines of Code | Action | Rationale |
|---------------|--------|-----------|
| <200 | Consider combining | Too granular |
| **300-600** | ‚úÖ **OPTIMAL** | Sweet spot for testing & maintenance |
| >800 | **MUST split** | Too complex, hard to test |

### Git Commits (Conventional Commits)

**Format**: `<type>(<SD-ID>): <subject>`

```bash
git commit -m "feat(SD-XXX): Brief description

Detailed explanation of changes.

ü§ñ Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"
```

**Types**: feat, fix, docs, refactor, test, chore, perf

### Server Restart (After ANY Changes)

```bash
# Kill
pkill -f "node server.js"

# Build (if UI changes)
npm run build:client

# Restart
PORT=3000 node server.js

# Hard refresh browser
# Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) / Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
```

### Parallel Execution (Save Time)

**When Safe**:
- ‚úÖ Multiple independent file reads
- ‚úÖ Multiple database queries (read-only)
- ‚úÖ Sub-agent execution (different domains)

**NOT Safe**:
- ‚ùå Write operations
- ‚ùå Database mutations
- ‚ùå Sequential dependencies

**Example**:
```bash
# LEAD Pre-Approval: 4 sub-agents in parallel
node scripts/systems-analyst-codebase-audit.js <SD-ID> &
node scripts/database-architect-schema-review.js <SD-ID> &
node scripts/security-architect-assessment.js <SD-ID> &
node scripts/design-subagent-evaluation.js <SD-ID> &
wait

# Reduces time from 2 minutes sequential to 30 seconds parallel
```

### Context Efficiency Patterns

```javascript
// ‚ùå Inefficient
const { data } = await supabase.from('table').select('*');
console.log(data); // Dumps full JSON

// ‚úÖ Efficient
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('table')
  .select('id, title, status')
  .limit(5);
console.log(`Found ${data.length} items`);
```

### Database Operations (One at a Time)

**CRITICAL**: When manipulating Supabase tables, operate on ONE table at a time.

```javascript
// ‚ùå Bad: Batch across tables
await Promise.all([
  supabase.from('table1').insert(data1),
  supabase.from('table2').insert(data2)
]);

// ‚úÖ Good: Sequential, one table at a time
await supabase.from('table1').insert(data1);
// Verify success
await supabase.from('table2').insert(data2);
// Verify success
```

### Sub-Agent Orchestration

**Automated** (preferred):
```bash
# Orchestrator runs all required sub-agents for phase
node scripts/orchestrate-phase-subagents.js <PHASE> <SD-ID>

# Phases: LEAD_PRE_APPROVAL, PLAN_PRD, EXEC_IMPL, PLAN_VERIFY, LEAD_FINAL
```

**Manual** (if needed):
```bash
# QA Director
node scripts/qa-engineering-director-enhanced.js <SD-ID> --full-e2e

# GitHub Actions
node scripts/github-actions-verifier.js <SD-ID>

# Database Architect
node scripts/database-architect-schema-review.js <SD-ID>
```

### Testing Commands

```bash
# Unit tests (business logic)
npm run test:unit

# E2E tests (user flows)
npm run test:e2e

# Both (MANDATORY before EXEC‚ÜíPLAN handoff)
npm run test:unit && npm run test:e2e
```

### Handoff Creation

```bash
# Unified handoff system (with auto sub-agent orchestration)
node scripts/unified-handoff-system.js execute <TYPE> <SD-ID>

# Types:
# - LEAD-to-PLAN
# - PLAN-to-EXEC
# - EXEC-to-PLAN (auto-runs PLAN_VERIFY sub-agents)
# - PLAN-to-LEAD (auto-runs LEAD_FINAL sub-agents)
```

### Progress Verification

```bash
# Check progress breakdown
node -e "
const { createClient } = require('@supabase/supabase-js');
const supabase = createClient(process.env.SUPABASE_URL, process.env.SUPABASE_ANON_KEY);
(async () => {
  const { data } = await supabase.rpc('get_progress_breakdown', { sd_id_param: 'SD-XXX' });
  console.log(JSON.stringify(data, null, 2));
})();
"
```

## üîß CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW

**Development Workflow**: MANDATORY server restart after ANY changes

**Steps**: Kill server ‚Üí Build client (`npm run build:client`) ‚Üí Restart server ‚Üí Hard refresh browser
**Why**: No hot-reloading configured, dist/ serves compiled files
**Commands**: `pkill -f "node server.js" && npm run build:client && PORT=3000 node server.js`

**Complete Guide**: See `docs/reference/development-workflow.md`

# PLAN PHASE CONTEXT

## Context Management Throughout Execution

## üß† CONTEXT MANAGEMENT (Throughout Execution)

**Token Budget**: 200,000 tokens

### Status Thresholds

| Status | Range | Percentage | Action |
|--------|-------|------------|--------|
| üü¢ HEALTHY | 0-140K | 0-70% | Continue normally |
| üü° WARNING | 140K-180K | 70-90% | Consider `/context-compact` |
| üî¥ CRITICAL | 180K-190K | 90-95% | MUST compact before handoff |
| üö® EMERGENCY | >190K | >95% | BLOCKED - force handoff |

### Report in EVERY Handoff

**Mandatory section in all handoffs**:
```markdown
## Context Health
**Current Usage**: X tokens (Y% of 200K budget)
**Status**: HEALTHY/WARNING/CRITICAL
**Recommendation**: [action if needed]
**Compaction Needed**: YES/NO
```

### Efficiency Rules

**Always apply these practices**:

1. **Select specific columns** (not `SELECT *`)
   ```javascript
   // ‚ùå Bad
   .select('*')

   // ‚úÖ Good
   .select('id, title, status, priority')
   ```

2. **Limit results** for large datasets
   ```javascript
   .limit(5)  // For summaries
   .limit(50) // For dashboards
   ```

3. **Summarize, don't dump**
   ```javascript
   // ‚ùå Bad: Full JSON dump
   console.log(results);

   // ‚úÖ Good: Summary
   console.log(`Found ${results.length} tests: ${passed} passed, ${failed} failed`);
   ```

4. **Use Read tool with offset/limit** for large files
   ```javascript
   Read('file.js', { offset: 100, limit: 50 })
   ```

5. **Compress sub-agent reports** (3-tier system)
   - TIER 1 (CRITICAL): Full detail for blockers
   - TIER 2 (IMPORTANT): Structured summary for warnings
   - TIER 3 (INFORMATIONAL): One-line for passing checks

### Expected Impact

Applying these rules: **90-98% token reduction per query**

### Compaction Command

When WARNING or CRITICAL:
```bash
/context-compact [focus area]
```

Example:
```bash
/context-compact database-schema
```

## Deferred Work Management


## Deferred Work Management

**Purpose**: Prevent losing track of work when reducing SD scope

**Root Cause** (SD-VENTURE-BACKEND-002 Lesson):
When SD-VENTURE-IDEATION-MVP-001's backend scope was deferred, no child SD was created immediately. Work was completed 6 months later but without tracking, requiring extensive backfill to restore LEO Protocol compliance.

**The Problem**:
- LEAD approves SD with 100 story points
- During PLAN, team realizes 40 points should be deferred
- PRD created with 60 points, work proceeds
- Deferred 40 points forgotten ‚Üí completed later without tracking ‚Üí backfill nightmare

---

### MANDATORY PROCESS: Create Child SD Immediately

**WHEN**: During PLAN phase, if any work is removed/deferred from approved scope

**REQUIRED ACTION**:
1. **Create child SD BEFORE finalizing PRD**
2. **Transfer user stories** to child SD
3. **Document relationship** in both SDs
4. **Set priority** based on criticality
5. **Link PRDs** (parent PRD references child SD)

---

### Example Workflow

**Scenario**: SD-VENTURE-MVP-001 approved for 10 user stories (100 points)

**PLAN discovers**: Stories 6-10 (40 points) are backend-only, can be deferred

**CORRECT Process** ‚úÖ:

```bash
# 1. Create child SD immediately
INSERT INTO strategic_directives_v2 (
  id, title, description, priority, status,
  parent_directive_id, relationship_type
) VALUES (
  'SD-VENTURE-BACKEND-001',
  'Venture Backend Implementation',
  'Deferred backend work from SD-VENTURE-MVP-001',
  'high',           -- Set based on business need
  'approved',       -- Already approved via parent
  'SD-VENTURE-MVP-001',
  'deferred_scope'
);

# 2. Transfer user stories to child SD
UPDATE user_stories
SET sd_id = 'SD-VENTURE-BACKEND-001'
WHERE sd_id = 'SD-VENTURE-MVP-001'
AND id IN ('US-006', 'US-007', 'US-008', 'US-009', 'US-010');

# 3. Update parent PRD to document deferral
UPDATE product_requirements_v2
SET metadata = metadata || jsonb_build_object(
  'scope_reductions', jsonb_build_array(
    jsonb_build_object(
      'deferred_to', 'SD-VENTURE-BACKEND-001',
      'user_stories', ARRAY['US-006', 'US-007', 'US-008', 'US-009', 'US-010'],
      'story_points', 40,
      'reason', 'Backend implementation deferred to separate sprint',
      'deferred_at', NOW()
    )
  )
)
WHERE id = 'PRD-VENTURE-MVP-001';

# 4. Create child PRD immediately (or mark as TODO)
-- Option A: Create minimal PRD now
INSERT INTO product_requirements_v2 (
  id, sd_uuid, title, status, progress,
  deferred_from
) VALUES (
  'PRD-VENTURE-BACKEND-001',
  (SELECT uuid_id FROM strategic_directives_v2 WHERE id = 'SD-VENTURE-BACKEND-001'),
  'Venture Backend Implementation',
  'planning',  -- Will be worked on later
  0,
  'PRD-VENTURE-MVP-001'
);

-- Option B: Add TODO to parent SD notes
-- "TODO: Create PRD-VENTURE-BACKEND-001 when ready to start backend work"
```

---

### Backfill Process (If Child SD Was Not Created)

**Scenario**: Work completed without tracking (like SD-VENTURE-BACKEND-002)

**Required Steps**:

1. **Create SD record**
   - Use historical commit data for dates
   - Set status: 'completed'

2. **Create PRD**
   - Set status: 'implemented' (not 'planning')
   - Set progress: 100

3. **Create user stories**
   - Extract from git commits
   - Set verification_status: 'passing' or 'validated'
   - Put in BOTH user_stories AND sd_backlog_map tables

4. **Create deliverables**
   - Extract from git history
   - Map to valid deliverable_types: api, test, documentation, migration
   - Mark all as completion_status: 'completed'

5. **Create handoffs**
   - EXEC‚ÜíPLAN: Implementation summary
   - PLAN‚ÜíLEAD: Verification summary
   - Use manual creation (validation gates not suitable for backfill)

6. **Create retrospective**
   - Document lessons learned
   - Note: "Tracking backfilled retroactively"

7. **Mark SD complete**
   - Fix any blocking issues first
   - Ensure all progress gates pass

**Backfill Scripts Created**: See /scripts/create-*-venture-backend-002-*.mjs

### Checklist: Scope Reduction Decision Point

Use this during PLAN phase when considering scope changes:

- [ ] **Identify deferred work**: Which user stories/deliverables are being removed?
- [ ] **Assess criticality**: Is this work needed eventually? (If yes ‚Üí child SD required)
- [ ] **Create child SD**: Don't defer this step! Create the SD now.
- [ ] **Transfer user stories**: Move them to child SD immediately
- [ ] **Set priority**: high/medium/low based on business need
- [ ] **Document relationship**: Update parent PRD metadata
- [ ] **Create child PRD** (minimal) OR add TODO to parent notes
- [ ] **Notify LEAD**: "Scope reduced, child SD created: SD-XXX"

---

### Red Flags (Lessons from SD-VENTURE-BACKEND-002)

‚ùå **"We'll create the SD later when we work on it"**
   - Result: Work gets forgotten or done without tracking

‚ùå **"Let's just note it in the parent PRD description"**
   - Result: No tracking, no progress visibility, no reminders

‚ùå **"It's only 3 user stories, not worth a separate SD"**
   - Result: Those 3 stories = 25 deliverables, 4 commits, 2 handoffs to backfill

‚úÖ **"Scope changed, creating child SD now"**
   - Result: Work tracked from day 1, no backfill needed

---

### Documentation Updates

This section added to LEO Protocol based on:
- **Incident**: SD-VENTURE-BACKEND-002 backfill (Oct 19, 2025)
- **Root Cause**: Child SD not created when backend scope deferred
- **Solution**: Mandatory child SD creation at scope reduction point
- **Prevention**: PLAN checklist enforcement, LEAD verification

**Related Sections**:
- Phase 2 (PLAN Pre-EXEC Checklist): Added scope reduction check
- Phase 4 (LEAD Verification): Verify child SDs created for deferrals
- Retrospective Templates: Include "Deferred work management" assessment

---

### Integration with Existing Workflow

**PLAN Agent** must now:
1. Check for scope reductions during PRD creation
2. Create child SDs for any deferred work
3. Document relationship in metadata
4. Report to LEAD in PLAN‚ÜíLEAD handoff

**LEAD Agent** must verify:
- Any scope reduction has corresponding child SD
- Child SD has appropriate priority
- Parent-child relationship documented
- User stories transferred correctly

**Progress Tracking**:
- Parent SD progress: Based on reduced scope (60 points)
- Child SD progress: Tracked independently (40 points)
- Portfolio view: Shows both SDs with relationship

---

### FAQ

**Q: What if we're not sure the deferred work will ever be done?**
A: Create the child SD with priority: 'low'. Better to have it and not need it than lose track of potential work.

**Q: Can we combine multiple deferrals into one child SD?**
A: Yes, if they're related. Example: "SD-VENTURE-FUTURE-ENHANCEMENTS" for all nice-to-have features.

**Q: What if the deferred work changes significantly later?**
A: Update the child SD's PRD when you start working on it. The SD serves as a placeholder until then.

**Q: Do we need a full PRD for the child SD immediately?**
A: Minimal PRD is acceptable. At minimum: title, description, deferred_from reference. Full PRD created when work begins.

**Q: What section_type for database?**
A: Use 'PHASE_2_PLANNING' (belongs in PLAN phase guidance)



## ‚ö†Ô∏è Mandatory Process Scripts

## ‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY PROCESS SCRIPTS

**CRITICAL**: Bypassing these scripts will cause handoff failures and data quality issues.

### Required Scripts by Phase

**PLAN Phase - PRD Creation**:
```bash
# ALWAYS use this script to create PRDs
node scripts/add-prd-to-database.js <SD-ID> [PRD-Title]

# Example:
node scripts/add-prd-to-database.js SD-EXPORT-001 "Export Feature PRD"
```

**Why mandatory:**
- Auto-triggers Product Requirements Expert (STORIES sub-agent)
- Generates user stories WITH implementation context
- Validates PRD schema and completeness
- Creates proper audit trail

**If you bypass:** PLAN‚ÜíEXEC handoff will fail due to missing implementation context.

---

**All Phases - Handoff Creation**:
```bash
# ALWAYS use unified handoff system
node scripts/unified-handoff-system.js execute <TYPE> <SD-ID>

# Types: LEAD-to-PLAN, PLAN-to-EXEC, EXEC-to-PLAN, PLAN-to-LEAD
```

**Why mandatory:**
- Runs validation gates (BMAD, Git branch enforcement)
- Triggers required sub-agents automatically
- Ensures 7-element handoff structure
- Enforces quality standards

**If you bypass:** Phase transitions will be blocked by database constraints.

---

### ‚ùå NEVER Do This

```javascript
// ‚ùå WRONG: Direct database insert
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('product_requirements_v2')
  .insert({ title: 'My PRD', ... });

// ‚ùå WRONG: Manual user story creation
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('user_stories')
  .insert({ title: 'My Story', ... });
```

**Why this fails:**
- Bypasses STORIES sub-agent (no implementation context)
- Bypasses validation gates
- Missing required structured data
- Breaks audit trail
- **Database constraints will block invalid inserts**

---

### ‚úÖ Always Do This

```bash
# ‚úÖ CORRECT: Use process scripts
node scripts/add-prd-to-database.js SD-XXX "PRD Title"
# ‚Üí Auto-triggers STORIES sub-agent

### Database Enforcement

The following constraints enforce process compliance:

- `product_requirements_v2.functional_requirements` must have ‚â•3 items
- `product_requirements_v2.test_scenarios` must have ‚â•1 item  
- `product_requirements_v2.acceptance_criteria` must have ‚â•1 item
- `user_stories.implementation_context` must be populated (not NULL, not empty)

**Attempting to bypass scripts will result in database constraint violations.**

## PR Size Guidelines

**Philosophy**: Balance AI capability with human review capacity. Modern AI can handle larger changes, but humans still need to review them.

**Three Tiers**:

1. **‚â§100 lines (Sweet Spot)** - No justification needed
   - Simple bug fixes
   - Single feature additions
   - Configuration changes
   - Documentation updates

2. **101-200 lines (Acceptable)** - Brief justification in PR description
   - Multi-component features
   - Refactoring with tests
   - Database migrations with updates
   - Example: "Adds authentication UI (3 components) + tests"

3. **201-400 lines (Requires Strong Justification)** - Detailed rationale required
   - Complex features that cannot be reasonably split
   - Large refactorings with extensive test coverage
   - Third-party integrations with configuration
   - Must explain why splitting would create more risk/complexity
   - Example: "OAuth integration requires provider config, UI flows, session management, and error handling as atomic unit"

**Over 400 lines**: Generally prohibited. Split into multiple PRs unless exceptional circumstances (emergency hotfix, external dependency forcing bundled changes).

**Key Principle**: If you can split it without creating incomplete/broken intermediate states, you should split it.

## Multi-Application Testing Architecture

**Multi-App Testing**: Two independent test suites (EHG_Engineer + EHG app).

**CRITICAL**: Determine target app from SD context before running tests
- **EHG_Engineer**: Vitest + Jest (50% coverage)
- **EHG**: Vitest (unit) + Playwright (E2E)

**Full Guide**: See `docs/reference/multi-app-testing.md`

## Enhanced QA Engineering Director v2.0 - Testing-First Edition

**Enhanced QA Engineering Director v2.0**: Mission-critical testing automation with comprehensive E2E validation.

**Core Capabilities:**
1. Professional test case generation from user stories
2. Pre-test build validation (saves 2-3 hours)
3. Database migration verification (prevents 1-2 hours debugging)
4. **Mandatory E2E testing via Playwright** (REQUIRED for approval)
5. Test infrastructure discovery and reuse

**5-Phase Workflow**: Pre-flight checks ‚Üí Test generation ‚Üí E2E execution ‚Üí Evidence collection ‚Üí Verdict & learnings

**Activation**: Auto-triggers on `EXEC_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE`, coverage keywords, testing evidence requests

**Full Guide**: See `docs/reference/qa-director-guide.md`

## PLAN Pre-EXEC Checklist

## PLAN Agent Pre-EXEC Checklist (MANDATORY)

**Evidence from Retrospectives**: Database verification issues appeared in SD-UAT-003, SD-UAT-020, and SD-008. Early verification saves 2-3 hours per blocker.

Before creating PLAN‚ÜíEXEC handoff, PLAN agent MUST verify:

### Database Dependencies ‚úÖ
- [ ] **Identify all data dependencies** in PRD
- [ ] **Run schema verification script** for data-dependent SDs
- [ ] **Verify tables/columns exist** OR create migration
- [ ] **Document verification results** in PLAN‚ÜíEXEC handoff
- [ ] If tables missing: **Escalate to LEAD** with options

**Success Pattern** (SD-UAT-003):
> "Database Architect verification provided evidence for LEAD decision. Documented instead of implementing ‚Üí saved 4-6 hours"

### Architecture Planning ‚úÖ
- [ ] **Component sizing estimated** (target 300-600 lines per component)
- [ ] **Existing infrastructure identified** (don't rebuild what exists)
- [ ] **Third-party libraries considered** before custom code

**Success Pattern** (SD-UAT-020):
> "Leveraged existing Supabase Auth instead of building custom ‚Üí saved 8-10 hours"

### Testing Strategy ‚úÖ
- [ ] **Smoke tests defined** (3-5 tests minimum)
- [ ] **Test scenarios documented** in PRD

### Quality Validation ‚úÖ
- [ ] **Verified claims with code review** (if UI/UX SD)
- [ ] **Assessed technical feasibility**
- [ ] **Identified potential blockers**

**Success Pattern** (SD-UAT-002):
> "LEAD code review rejected 3/5 false claims ‚Üí saved hours of unnecessary work"


## Testing Tier Strategy

## Testing Requirements - Clear Thresholds

**Evidence from Retrospectives**: Testing confusion appeared in SD-UAT-002, SD-UAT-020, SD-008.

### Three-Tier Testing Strategy

#### Tier 1: Smoke Tests (MANDATORY) ‚úÖ
- **Requirement**: 3-5 tests, <60 seconds execution
- **Approval**: **SUFFICIENT for PLAN‚ÜíLEAD approval**

#### Tier 2: Comprehensive E2E (RECOMMENDED) üìã
- **Requirement**: 30-50 tests covering user flows
- **Approval**: Nice to have, **NOT blocking for LEAD approval**
- **Timing**: Can be refined post-deployment

#### Tier 3: Manual Testing (SITUATIONAL) üîç
- **UI changes**: Single smoke test recommended (+5 min)
- **Logic changes <5 lines**: Optional
- **Logic changes >10 lines**: Required

### Anti-Pattern to Avoid ‚ùå

**DO NOT** create 100+ manual test checklists unless specifically required.

**From SD-UAT-020**:
> "Created 100+ test checklist but didn't execute manually. Time spent on unused documentation."

## Component Sizing Guidelines

## Component Sizing Guidelines

**Evidence from Retrospectives**: Proven pattern in SD-UAT-020 and SD-008.

### Optimal Component Size: 300-600 Lines

**Success Pattern** (SD-UAT-020):
> "Split settings into three focused components. Each ~500 lines. Easy to test and maintain."

### Sizing Rules

| Lines of Code | Action | Rationale |
|---------------|--------|-----------|
| **<200** | Consider combining | Too granular |
| **300-600** | ‚úÖ **OPTIMAL** | Sweet spot |
| **>800** | **MUST split** | Too complex |

## üî¨ BMAD Method Enhancements

## üî¨ BMAD Method Enhancements

**BMAD** (Build-Measure-Adapt-Document) Method principles integrated into LEO Protocol to reduce context consumption, improve implementation quality, and enable early error detection.

### Core Principles

1. **Dev Agents Must Be Lean**: Minimize context consumption throughout workflow
2. **Natural Language First**: Reduce code-heavy implementation guidance
3. **Context-Engineered Stories**: Front-load implementation details to reduce EXEC confusion
4. **Risk Assessment**: Multi-domain analysis during LEAD_PRE_APPROVAL
5. **Mid-Development Quality Gates**: Checkpoint pattern for large SDs
6. **Early Validation**: Catch issues at gates, not during final testing

---

### Six BMAD Enhancements

**1. Risk Assessment Sub-Agent (RISK)**
- **Phase**: LEAD_PRE_APPROVAL (mandatory for all SDs)
- **Purpose**: Multi-domain risk scoring before approval
- **Domains**: Technical Complexity (1-10), Security Risk (1-10), Performance Risk (1-10), Integration Risk (1-10), Data Migration Risk (1-10), UI/UX Risk (1-10)
- **Storage**: risk_assessments table
- **Script**: node lib/sub-agent-executor.js RISK SD-ID
- **Benefit**: Early risk identification prevents 4-6 hours rework per SD

**2. User Story Context Engineering (STORIES)**
- **Phase**: PLAN_PRD (after PRD creation, before EXEC)
- **Purpose**: Hyper-detailed implementation context for each user story
- **Fields Added**: implementation_context, architecture_references, example_code_patterns, testing_scenarios
- **Storage**: user_stories table columns
- **Script**: node lib/sub-agent-executor.js STORIES SD-ID
- **Benefit**: Reduces EXEC confusion by 30-40% through front-loaded guidance
- **Validation**: PLAN‚ÜíEXEC handoff checks for ‚â•80% coverage

**3. Retrospective Review for LEAD**
- **Phase**: LEAD_PRE_APPROVAL (before approving new SDs)
- **Purpose**: Learn from similar completed SDs
- **Analysis**: Success patterns, failure patterns, effort adjustments, risk mitigations
- **Storage**: Queries retrospectives table
- **Script**: node scripts/retrospective-review-for-lead.js SD-ID
- **Benefit**: Informed decision-making based on historical data

**4. Checkpoint Pattern Generator**
- **Phase**: PLAN_PRD (for SDs with >8 user stories)
- **Purpose**: Break large SDs into 3-4 manageable checkpoints
- **Benefits**: 30-40% context reduction, 50% faster debugging, early error detection
- **Storage**: strategic_directives_v2.checkpoint_plan (JSONB)
- **Script**: node scripts/generate-checkpoint-plan.js SD-ID
- **Validation**: PLAN‚ÜíEXEC handoff requires checkpoint plan for large SDs

**5. Test Architecture Phase Enhancement**
- **Phase**: PLAN_PRD and PLAN_VERIFY (QA Director integration)
- **Purpose**: Structured test planning with 4 strategies
- **Strategies**: Unit (business logic), E2E (user flows), Integration (APIs/DB), Performance (benchmarks)
- **Storage**: test_plans table
- **Script**: QA Director auto-generates during PLAN phase
- **Benefit**: 100% user story ‚Üí E2E test mapping enforced
- **Validation**: EXEC‚ÜíPLAN handoff checks test plan existence and coverage

**6. Lean EXEC_CONTEXT.md**
- **Phase**: EXEC_IMPLEMENTATION (context optimization)
- **Purpose**: Reduced CLAUDE.md for EXEC agents (~500 lines vs 5000+)
- **Content**: EXEC-specific guidance only (no LEAD/PLAN operations)
- **Location**: docs/EXEC_CONTEXT.md
- **Benefit**: 90% context reduction during EXEC phase

## CI/CD Pipeline Verification

## CI/CD Pipeline Verification (MANDATORY)

**Evidence from Retrospectives**: Gap identified in SD-UAT-002 and SD-LEO-002.

### Verification Process

**After EXEC implementation complete, BEFORE PLAN‚ÜíLEAD handoff**:

1. Wait 2-3 minutes for GitHub Actions to complete
2. Trigger DevOps sub-agent to verify pipeline status
3. Document CI/CD status in PLAN‚ÜíLEAD handoff
4. PLAN‚ÜíLEAD handoff is **BLOCKED** if pipelines failing

## Pre-Implementation Plan Presentation Template

## Pre-Implementation Plan Presentation Template

**SD-PLAN-PRESENT-001** | **Template Type:** plan_presentation | **Phase:** PLAN ‚Üí EXEC

### Purpose

The `plan_presentation` template standardizes PLAN‚ÜíEXEC handoffs by providing structured implementation guidance to the EXEC agent. This template reduces EXEC confusion from 15-20 minutes to <5 minutes by clearly communicating:

- **What** will be implemented (goal_summary)
- **Where** changes will occur (file_scope)
- **How** to implement step-by-step (execution_plan)
- **Dependencies** and impacts (dependency_impacts)
- **Testing approach** (testing_strategy)

### Template Structure

All plan_presentation objects must be included in the `metadata.plan_presentation` field of PLAN‚ÜíEXEC handoffs.

#### Required Fields

1. **goal_summary** (string, ‚â§300 chars, required)
   - Brief 2-3 sentence summary of implementation goals
   - Focus on "what" and "why", not "how"
   - Example: `"Add plan_presentation template to leo_handoff_templates table with JSONB validation structure. Enhance unified-handoff-system.js with validation logic (~50 LOC). Reduce EXEC confusion from 15-20 min to <5 min."`

2. **file_scope** (object, required)
   - Lists files to create, modify, or delete
   - At least one category must have ‚â•1 file
   - Structure:
     ```json
     {
       "create": ["path/to/new-file.js"],
       "modify": ["path/to/existing-file.js"],
       "delete": ["path/to/deprecated-file.js"]
     }
     ```

3. **execution_plan** (array, required, ‚â•1 step)
   - Step-by-step implementation sequence
   - Each step includes: step number, action description, affected files
   - Structure:
     ```json
     [
       {
         "step": 1,
         "action": "Add validatePlanPresentation() method to PlanToExecVerifier class",
         "files": ["scripts/verify-handoff-plan-to-exec.js"]
       },
       {
         "step": 2,
         "action": "Integrate validation into verifyHandoff() method",
         "files": ["scripts/verify-handoff-plan-to-exec.js"]
       }
     ]
     ```

4. **testing_strategy** (object, required)
   - Specifies unit test and E2E test approaches
   - Both unit_tests and e2e_tests fields required
   - Structure:
     ```json
     {
       "unit_tests": "Test validatePlanPresentation() with valid, missing, and invalid structures",
       "e2e_tests": "Create PLAN‚ÜíEXEC handoff and verify validation enforcement",
       "verification_steps": [
         "Run test script with 3 scenarios",
         "Verify validation passes for complete plan_presentation"
       ]
     }
     ```

#### Optional Fields

5. **dependency_impacts** (object, optional)
   - Documents dependencies and their impacts
   - Structure:
     ```json
     {
       "npm_packages": ["react-hook-form", "zod"],
       "internal_modules": ["handoff-validator.js"],
       "database_changes": "None (reads from leo_handoff_templates)"
     }
     ```

### Validation Rules

The `verify-handoff-plan-to-exec.js` script validates plan_presentation structure:

- ‚úÖ `goal_summary` present and ‚â§300 characters
- ‚úÖ `file_scope` has at least one of: create, modify, delete
- ‚úÖ `execution_plan` has ‚â•1 step
- ‚úÖ `testing_strategy` has both `unit_tests` and `e2e_tests` defined

**Validation Enforcement:** PLAN‚ÜíEXEC handoffs are rejected if plan_presentation is missing or invalid.

### Complete Example

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "plan_presentation": {
      "goal_summary": "Add plan_presentation template to leo_handoff_templates table with JSONB validation structure. Enhance unified-handoff-system.js with validation logic (~50 LOC). Reduce EXEC confusion from 15-20 min to <5 min.",
      "file_scope": {
        "create": [],
        "modify": ["scripts/verify-handoff-plan-to-exec.js"],
        "delete": []
      },
      "execution_plan": [
        {
          "step": 1,
          "action": "Add validatePlanPresentation() method to PlanToExecVerifier class",
          "files": ["scripts/verify-handoff-plan-to-exec.js"]
        },
        {
          "step": 2,
          "action": "Integrate validation into verifyHandoff() method",
          "files": ["scripts/verify-handoff-plan-to-exec.js"]
        },
        {
          "step": 3,
          "action": "Add PLAN_PRESENTATION_INVALID rejection handler",
          "files": ["scripts/verify-handoff-plan-to-exec.js"]
        }
      ],
      "dependency_impacts": {
        "npm_packages": [],
        "internal_modules": ["handoff-validator.js"],
        "database_changes": "None (reads from leo_handoff_templates)"
      },
      "testing_strategy": {
        "unit_tests": "Test validatePlanPresentation() with valid, missing, and invalid structures",
        "e2e_tests": "Create PLAN‚ÜíEXEC handoff and verify validation enforcement",
        "verification_steps": [
          "Run test script with 3 scenarios (TS1, TS2, TS3)",
          "Verify validation passes for complete plan_presentation",
          "Verify validation fails with clear errors for incomplete/invalid structures"
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Benefits

- **Reduced Confusion:** EXEC spends <5 min understanding implementation (vs 15-20 min)
- **Consistent Handoffs:** All PLAN‚ÜíEXEC handoffs follow same structure
- **Auditability:** Implementation decisions queryable via metadata
- **Quality Gate:** Invalid handoffs rejected before EXEC phase begins
