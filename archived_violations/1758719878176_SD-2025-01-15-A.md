**To:** PLAN Agent  
**From:** LEAD Agent  
**Protocol:** LEO Protocol v3.1.5  
**Strategic Directive:** SD-2025-01-15-A: EHG_Engineer Platform Foundation  
**Strategic Directive Path:** `docs/wbs_artefacts/strategic_directives/SD-2025-01-15-A.md`

## Directive Metadata

- **SD-ID**: SD-2025-01-15-A
- **Title**: EHG_Engineer Platform Foundation
- **Status**: DRAFT
- **Priority**: CRITICAL
- **Execution Order**: 1
- **Created Date**: 2025-01-15
- **Target Completion**: 2025-02-15

## Strategic Context

### Problem Statement
The existing EHG platform contains many features not relevant to new application development, creating complexity and confusion. We need a clean, focused LEO Protocol implementation that can be used for building other applications with strategic directive management.

### Business Impact
This foundation will enable rapid application development with proven LEO Protocol workflows, reducing time-to-market and ensuring consistent strategic planning across multiple projects.

### Technical Scope
Core LEO Protocol implementation including strategic directive management, epic execution sequences, database schema, and agent communication protocols.

## Strategic Objective

### Primary Goal
Establish a minimal, clean LEO Protocol v3.1.5 implementation that can serve as the foundation for building other applications with strategic directive management capabilities.

### Success Criteria
1. Complete LEO Protocol v3.1.5 implementation with all core components
2. Functional database schema with strategic directives, EES, and HAP blocks
3. Working agent communication protocols (LEAD/PLAN/EXEC/HUMAN)
4. Template system for creating new strategic directives and execution sequences
5. End-to-end workflow validation with real strategic directive implementation

### Key Constraints
- Must be minimal footprint (no unnecessary features)
- Must follow LEO Protocol v3.1.5 standards exactly
- Must be database-first architecture with Supabase
- Must support agent communication protocols
- Must be extensible for future applications

## Implementation Approach

### High-Level Strategy
Extract and adapt proven LEO Protocol components from EHG platform while maintaining clean separation and minimal complexity.

### Key Principles
1. **Database-First**: All state managed in Supabase, files for documentation
2. **Agent-Centric**: Workflow designed around LEAD/PLAN/EXEC/HUMAN roles
3. **Compliance-Driven**: Built-in validation and verification at every step
4. **Minimal Footprint**: Only essential components, no bloat
5. **Extensible Foundation**: Can add features as needed

### Implementation Phases
1. **Phase 1**: Project foundation and structure (COMPLETE)
2. **Phase 2**: Database schema and core scripts (COMPLETE)
3. **Phase 3**: Templates and documentation system (COMPLETE)
4. **Phase 4**: First strategic directive and end-to-end testing (IN PROGRESS)

## Epic Execution Sequences (EES)

### EES Breakdown
| EES ID | Title | Priority | Estimated Effort | Dependencies |
|--------|-------|----------|------------------|-------------|
| EES-2025-01-15-A-01 | Platform Foundation Setup | CRITICAL | 3 HAP blocks | None |
| EES-2025-01-15-A-02 | Database Schema Implementation | CRITICAL | 2 HAP blocks | EES-01 |
| EES-2025-01-15-A-03 | Template System Creation | HIGH | 2 HAP blocks | EES-02 |
| EES-2025-01-15-A-04 | End-to-End Workflow Testing | HIGH | 2 HAP blocks | EES-03 |

### EES Sequencing
EES-01 establishes the basic project structure. EES-02 implements the database schema. EES-03 creates the template system. EES-04 validates the complete workflow with real data.

## Risk Assessment

### Strategic Risks
| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|---------|------------|------------|
| Database schema incompatibility | HIGH | LOW | Use proven EHG schema as reference |
| LEO Protocol compliance gaps | HIGH | MEDIUM | Follow protocol documentation exactly |
| Template system complexity | MEDIUM | LOW | Keep templates simple and focused |
| Agent communication failures | HIGH | LOW | Use standardized templates |

### Dependencies
- Supabase database access and credentials
- LEO Protocol v3.1.5 documentation
- Existing EHG platform for reference components

## Success Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators
- **Database Connectivity**: 100% successful connection rate
- **Template Generation**: All templates create valid artifacts
- **Agent Communication**: All handoffs follow protocol standards
- **End-to-End Workflow**: Complete SD → EES → Implementation cycle
- **Compliance Score**: 100% LEO Protocol v3.1.5 compliance

### Validation Methods
- Automated compliance audit: `npm run audit-compliance`
- Database verification: `npm run test-database`
- Template validation: Manual review of generated artifacts
- Workflow testing: Complete strategic directive lifecycle

## Gap Closure Reference
- GAP-001: Clean LEO Protocol implementation for new applications
- GAP-002: Minimal footprint strategic directive management
- GAP-003: Database-first architecture with Supabase integration
