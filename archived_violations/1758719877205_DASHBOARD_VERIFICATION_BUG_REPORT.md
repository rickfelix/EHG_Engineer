# Dashboard Verification Phase Bug Report

## Issue Description

The LEO Protocol dashboard shows **0% for Plan Verification phase** even when verification is complete, causing SD-2025-001 to show 85% instead of 100% completion.

## Root Cause

Dashboard calculation logic at `/lib/dashboard/server.js:238` filters for verification phase using:

```javascript
verification: calculatePhaseProgress(dashboardState.prds.filter(p => p.metadata.Status === 'Testing'))
```

**Problem**: This only counts PRDs currently in 'Testing' status, but completed verifications have status 'Complete', 'Verified', or similar. The filter finds no PRDs, so verification shows 0%.

## Current Database State

SD-2025-001 PRD has:
- `status: 'approved'` 
- `phase: 'complete'`
- `phase_progress: { VERIFICATION: 100 }`
- `metadata.Status: 'Testing'` (temporary fix)

## Proper Fix Required

Update dashboard calculation logic to handle completed verification phases:

```javascript
// Current (broken)
verification: calculatePhaseProgress(dashboardState.prds.filter(p => p.metadata.Status === 'Testing'))

// Should be (fixed)
verification: calculatePhaseProgress(dashboardState.prds.filter(p => 
  p.metadata.Status === 'Testing' || 
  (p.phase_progress?.VERIFICATION === 100) ||
  (p.metadata.verification_complete === true)
))
```

## Impact

- Strategic Directives show incorrect completion percentage
- Plan Verification phase always shows 0% for completed SDs
- Dashboard progress calculation is unreliable for completed projects

## Temporary Workaround

Set PRD `metadata.Status: 'Testing'` even after verification completion to make dashboard show correct percentage.

## Permanent Solution Needed

1. Update `/lib/dashboard/server.js` calculation logic to handle completed verification
2. Test with multiple SDs in different phases
3. Ensure completed verification phases show 100% not 0%
