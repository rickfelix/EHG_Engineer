# Audit Trail - Database Housekeeping Operations
## Date: 2025-09-22

## Staging Environment Setup

### Infrastructure Provisioning
- **Timestamp**: 2025-09-22 (Generated)
- **Action**: Created ephemeral staging PostgreSQL 16 environment
- **Location**: Docker container on port 5434
- **Container**: ehg_staging_db

### Credentials Generated
- **Admin User**: ehg_admin (permanent)
- **Service Users**: eng_service, vh_service, analyst_ro (permanent)
- **Codex User**: codex_staging
  - **Created**: 2025-09-22
  - **Expires**: 8 hours from creation
  - **Password**: cdx_K9mN3pQ7wL5xR2vT8bF6hJ4s[REDACTED]
  - **Permissions**: Limited INSERT/UPDATE on eng_*, SELECT on vh_*, no DDL

### Quality Gates

#### Pre-Staging Checks
- [ ] Docker environment configured
- [ ] Bootstrap script prepared
- [ ] Time-boxed credentials created
- [ ] RLS enforcement configured
- [ ] Audit logging enabled

#### Staging Validation (To be completed by Codex)
- [ ] Container healthy
- [ ] Database accessible
- [ ] Schemas created (eng, vh, audit, views)
- [ ] Extensions installed (uuid-ossp, pgcrypto)
- [ ] RLS enabled by default
- [ ] Codex user can connect
- [ ] Permissions verified

### Evidence Collection Points

```sql
-- Verify staging is ready
SELECT version();
SELECT current_database(), current_user;
SELECT * FROM audit.bootstrap_status;

-- Check RLS status
SHOW row_security;

-- Verify schemas
SELECT schema_name
FROM information_schema.schemata
WHERE schema_name IN ('eng', 'vh', 'audit', 'views')
ORDER BY schema_name;

-- Check user permissions
SELECT
  grantee,
  table_schema,
  table_name,
  privilege_type
FROM information_schema.role_table_grants
WHERE grantee = 'codex_staging'
  AND table_schema IN ('eng', 'vh')
LIMIT 10;
```

## Automation Close-Out
*Updated by Claude Code EXEC - 2025-09-22*

### Infrastructure Setup Complete
- [x] psql_exec.sh - Docker fallback wrapper created
- [x] dbexec.bundle.mjs - 168.5kb bundled tool (no npm required)
- [x] staging_apply.sh - Schema creation script ready
- [x] run_checks.sh - Verification script ready
- [x] run_backfills.sh - Data population script ready
- [x] hydrate_vh_linkage.sh - Linkage hydration script ready
- [x] vh_governance_ingest.ts - Placeholder ingest service created
- [x] housekeeping-staging.yml - GitHub Actions workflow configured

### Tools Available for Codex (no installation required)
1. **dbexec bundle**: `node tools/dbexec/dbexec.bundle.mjs [file.sql] --env .env.staging`
2. **GitHub Actions**: Manual trigger via workflow_dispatch
3. **psql wrapper**: Falls back to Docker if psql not found

### Execution Status (2025-09-22T14:45:00Z)

#### Local Execution Attempt
- [ ] staging_apply.sh - **Blocked**: No Docker/staging DB (ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:5434)
- [ ] run_checks.sh - **Blocked**: No Docker/staging DB available
- [ ] run_backfills.sh - **Blocked**: No Docker/staging DB available
- [ ] hydrate_vh_linkage.sh - **Blocked**: No Docker/staging DB available
- [x] vh_governance_ingest.ts (dry run) - **SUCCESS**: Test execution completed
  - Mode: DRY_RUN
  - Would process: 4 strategic directives, 3 projects, 6 tasks
  - Exit code: 0

#### Tools Verified
- [x] dbexec-simple.js created as fallback (requires pg module)
- [x] psql_exec.sh ready (requires Docker or psql)
- [x] GitHub Actions workflow configured and ready
- [x] All shell scripts marked executable

#### Recommended Next Steps
1. **Option A - GitHub Actions** (Recommended):
   - Add the 5 required secrets to repository settings
   - Trigger "Housekeeping Staging" workflow
   - Review automated audit log updates

2. **Option B - Local with Docker**:
   - Install Docker Desktop with WSL2 integration
   - Run `cd ops/stage && docker-compose up -d`
   - Execute scripts with psql_exec.sh wrapper

3. **Option C - Remote Staging DB**:
   - Update .env.staging with actual staging credentials
   - Use dbexec-simple.js or psql_exec.sh to connect

### Issues Encountered

### Remediations Applied
*(To be filled by Codex)*

## Production Promotion Readiness

### Go/No-Go Criteria
- [ ] All staging scripts completed successfully
- [ ] Zero errors in staging execution
- [ ] Audit trail complete
- [ ] Views compile without errors
- [ ] RLS policies active and tested
- [ ] Cross-boundary isolation verified
- [ ] Performance impact < 10%

### Sign-offs Required
- [ ] Codex Agent - Staging validation complete
- [ ] Claude Code (EXEC) - Infrastructure ready
- [ ] Human Operator - Reviewed and approved

## Risk Assessment

### Staging Risk: **LOW**
- Isolated environment
- No production data
- Time-boxed access
- Full audit trail

### Production Risk: **MEDIUM-HIGH** (if direct execution)
- Requires multiple backups
- Maintenance window mandatory
- Rollback plan required
- All gates must pass

## Compliance Notes

1. **Database-First Architecture**: All operations follow database-first principle
2. **Boundary Enforcement**: eng_* and vh_* schemas remain isolated
3. **RLS Mandatory**: Row-level security enforced on all sensitive tables
4. **Audit Trail**: All changes logged with timestamp and user
5. **Time-Boxing**: Staging credentials expire automatically

## Next Steps

1. **For Operator**:
   - Launch staging: `cd ops/stage && docker-compose up -d`
   - Hand credentials to Codex using ops/stage/run_codex_sequence.md
   - Monitor Codex execution

2. **For Codex**:
   - Connect using provided credentials
   - Execute scripts in sequence
   - Update this audit log with results
   - Report any failures immediately

3. **For Production** (after staging success):
   - Review ops/runbooks/prod_promotion_housekeeping.md
   - Schedule maintenance window
   - Execute promotion sequence
   - Monitor and validate
