## CI/CD Failure Investigation

### Likely Causes (Pre-existing)

Based on branch name `fix/database-migrations-and-lighthouse` and recent failures:

1. **Database Migration Issues** (being fixed in this branch)
   - Branch name suggests migration problems
   - May be related to prior SD work

2. **Lighthouse Performance Checks** (also being addressed)
   - Branch explicitly mentions Lighthouse
   - Performance budgets may be failing

3. **Docker Build Intermittency**
   - 1 success, 1 failure suggests flaky build
   - Possible network issues or dependency resolution

### Recommended Actions

#### Immediate (Before Pushing SD-BACKEND-002B)

1. **Check CI/CD Logs**
   ```bash
   cd /mnt/c/_EHG/ehg
   gh run view --log
   ```
   Identify exact failure reasons.

2. **Fix Existing CI/CD Issues**
   - Resolve database migration failures
   - Address Lighthouse performance issues
   - Stabilize Docker builds

3. **Run Local Tests**
   ```bash
   npm run test
   npm run build
   npm run lint
   ```
   Ensure SD-BACKEND-002B changes don't introduce new failures.

#### Before Merging SD-BACKEND-002B

4. **Create Feature Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/SD-BACKEND-002B-multi-company
   git add [SD-BACKEND-002B files]
   git commit -m "feat(SD-BACKEND-002B): Multi-company portfolio management backend"
   git push -u origin feature/SD-BACKEND-002B-multi-company
   ```

5. **Monitor CI/CD**
   - Wait for pipeline completion (2-3 minutes)
   - Verify tests pass
   - Check Docker build succeeds

6. **Create Pull Request**
   - Only after CI/CD passes
   - Include verification checklist
   - Reference retrospective

## Database State Verification

### Migration Already Applied ‚úÖ

**Confirmation**: Database migration executed successfully in production:
- Timestamp: 2025-10-03 10:46 AM
- Duration: 0.08 seconds
- Result: SUCCESS

**Database Changes Live**:
- ‚úÖ 7 columns added
- ‚úÖ 25 RLS policies active
- ‚úÖ 67 indexes created
- ‚úÖ 33 foreign keys enforcing company relationships

**Implication**: Database is production-ready. Code changes can be pushed when CI/CD stabilizes.

---

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk ‚úÖ
- **Migration already executed** - Database changes are live and verified
- **Local changes only** - No GitHub commits yet, can't break CI/CD further
- **Comprehensive verification** - All database checks passed

### Medium Risk ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **UI components untested** - React components not integration tested
- **Performance benchmarks missing** - Company switching speed not measured
- **CI/CD already failing** - Pre-existing pipeline issues

### Mitigation Strategy

**Option A: Fix CI/CD First (Recommended)**
1. Resolve existing `fix/database-migrations-and-lighthouse` failures
2. Get CI/CD green
3. Then push SD-BACKEND-002B changes
4. Verify CI/CD remains green

**Option B: Separate SD-BACKEND-002B Branch**
1. Create new branch from `main` (or latest stable)
2. Apply SD-BACKEND-002B changes
3. Push and verify CI/CD independently
4. Merge if green

**Recommendation**: Option B - Isolate SD-BACKEND-002B from pre-existing issues.

## Action Plan

### For LEAD Agent (Immediate)

1. **Do NOT push SD-BACKEND-002B to GitHub yet**
   - CI/CD is failing
   - Will trigger additional failed runs
   - Obscures root cause of failures

2. **Create Isolated Branch (Recommended)**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull
   git checkout -b feature/SD-BACKEND-002B-multi-company
   # Cherry-pick SD-BACKEND-002B changes
   ```

3. **Request CI/CD Fix First**
   - Fix `fix/database-migrations-and-lighthouse` branch failures
   - Get pipelines green
   - Then proceed with SD-BACKEND-002B push

### For Next Developer

4. **Local Testing Required**
   - Start dev server: `npm run dev`
   - Navigate to company settings page
   - Test company switching
   - Verify mission/vision editor works

5. **Integration Testing**
   - Create E2E tests for multi-company flows
   - Test RLS policies in UI
   - Verify role-based permissions

6. **Performance Testing**
   - Benchmark company switching (<300ms target)
   - Measure RLS query overhead
   - Load test with 100+ companies
