## ✅ All Work Completed

### Database Migration
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - All tables successfully created and verified
**Execution Time**: 45 minutes (including debugging)
**Verification**: `node scripts/verify-tables-direct.mjs` - ALL TABLES EXIST

**Migration Process**:
1. ✅ Attempted automated methods per MANDATORY CHECKLIST:
   - Method 1: PostgreSQL direct with aws-0 region → tenant not found error
   - Method 2: Fixed to aws-1 region → connection successful
   - Method 3: Fixed user references (removed FK to non-existent users table)
   - Method 4: Improved SQL parsing to handle PostgreSQL functions with $$ delimiters
2. ✅ Successfully executed migrations via `apply-backend-002c-migrations-direct.mjs`
3. ✅ Verified all 7 tables + 1 materialized view exist

**Tables Created**:
- ✅ financial_models
- ✅ financial_projections
- ✅ financial_scenarios
- ✅ risk_models
- ✅ risk_assessments
- ✅ risk_alerts
- ✅ portfolio_risk_summary (materialized view)
