# SD-051: LEAD Strategic Assessment

**Date**: 2025-10-03
**SD**: SD-051 - EVA Orchestration Engine: Consolidated
**LEAD Agent**: Strategic Leadership Agent
**Status**: Strategic Review in Progress

---

## Executive Summary

SD-051 "EVA Orchestration Engine: Consolidated" requires LEAD strategic decision due to insufficient scope and low business value.

**Current State**:
- Status: Active (30% progress)
- Phase: PLAN_DESIGN
- Priority: High (legacy)
- Category: AI & Automation

**Issue**: Only 1 of 4 features marked as KEEP, with 3 features DEFERRED.

---

## Scope Analysis

### Features from SD-BACKEND-003A Mapping

| Feature | Business Value | User Demand | Effort | Decision |
|---------|----------------|-------------|--------|----------|
| Workflow Management Interface | 6/10 | 4/10 | 40h | DEFER |
| **Worker Management** | **5/10** | **2/10** | **30h** | **KEEP** ‚úÖ |
| Performance Monitoring | 6/10 | 3/10 | 35h | DEFER |
| Queue Configuration | 6/10 | 3/10 | 20h | DEFER |

**Total Effort if all features**: 125h
**Actual Effort (KEEP only)**: 30h

---

## Strategic Assessment

### Business Value Analysis

**Worker Management Feature** (the only KEEP):
- Business Value: 5/10 (MEDIUM-LOW)
- User Demand: 2/10 (VERY LOW)
- Effort: 30 hours

**Assessment**:
- Low user demand (2/10) indicates users don't need this feature
- Medium-low business value (5/10) doesn't justify 30h investment
- No clear business case or user story
- No dependencies on this feature from other SDs

### Simplicity Gate Evaluation

Per CLAUDE.md, LEAD must apply simplicity assessment:

**Questions**:
1. **What's the simplest solution?** ‚Üí Don't build it (user demand is 2/10)
2. **Why not just configure existing tools?** ‚Üí No orchestration engine exists to manage
3. **Apply 80/20 rule** ‚Üí This feature is in the 20% low-impact work

**Verdict**: FAILS simplicity gate - Low ROI, low demand, no clear use case

### Priority Assessment

**Original Priority**: High (legacy from consolidation)
**Actual Priority**: Should be DEFERRED or CANCELLED

**Rationale**:
- User demand: 2/10 (users don't want this)
- Business value: 5/10 (marginal)
- No blocking dependencies
- No strategic initiatives requiring orchestration

---

## LEAD Decision Matrix

### Option 1: CANCEL SD-051 ‚úÖ RECOMMENDED

**Rationale**:
- Only 1 of 4 features remains (25% of original scope)
- That 1 feature has very low user demand (2/10)
- Business value is marginal (5/10)
- 30h effort not justified by demand/value
- No clear business case presented
- Fails simplicity gate

**Impact**: Minimal - users don't want this feature anyway

**Action**:
- Mark SD-051 as **CANCELLED**
- Reason: "Insufficient business value and user demand. Only 1 of 4 features marked KEEP, with BV=5/10 and UD=2/10. Fails simplicity gate."
- Archive SD with retrospective on why it was cancelled

### Option 2: DEFER SD-051

**Rationale**:
- Keep option open for future if orchestration needs emerge
- Re-evaluate when user demand increases
- Wait for clear business case

**Impact**: SD sits in backlog indefinitely

**Concern**: Clutters backlog with low-value work

### Option 3: PROCEED with Worker Management PRD

**Rationale**:
- Honor the original "KEEP" decision
- 30h investment is manageable

**Concern**:
- User demand is 2/10 (users don't want it)
- No clear use case or business justification
- Violates simplicity principle
- Wastes 30h on unused feature

## LEO Protocol Alignment

Per CLAUDE.md, LEAD responsibilities include:

> "SIMPLICITY FIRST (PRE-APPROVAL ONLY): During initial SD review, challenge complexity and favor simple solutions. Ask 'What's the simplest solution?' and 'Why not just configure existing tools?' Apply 80/20 rule BEFORE approval."

**This is a PRE-APPROVAL scenario** - SD is at PLAN_DESIGN phase, not yet approved for EXEC.

**Simplicity Assessment**:
- ‚ùå Simplest solution: Don't build (no demand)
- ‚ùå Configure existing: No orchestration exists
- ‚ùå 80/20 rule: This is low-impact 20% work
- ‚ùå User demand: 2/10 indicates users prefer alternatives

**Conclusion**: SD-051 should be CANCELLED per simplicity principle.

## Recommendation

### ‚úÖ CANCEL SD-051

**Formal Decision**:
I, as LEAD Agent, recommend **CANCELLING** SD-051 for the following reasons:

1. **Insufficient Scope**: Only 25% of original features remain (1 of 4)
2. **Low User Demand**: 2/10 indicates users don't need this
3. **Marginal Business Value**: 5/10 doesn't justify 30h investment
4. **Fails Simplicity Gate**: Violates "build what users want" principle
5. **No Business Case**: No clear user story or strategic need
6. **Better ROI Available**: 30h better spent on high-demand features

**Status Change**: active ‚Üí cancelled
**Reason**: "Cancelled per LEAD simplicity assessment. User demand 2/10 and business value 5/10 insufficient to justify 30h investment. Original SD scope reduced to 25% (1 of 4 features). No clear business case or user demand for orchestration worker management."

---

## Alternative Recommendation

If stakeholders object to cancellation:

### ‚úÖ DEFER SD-051 (Fallback)

**Status Change**: active ‚Üí deferred
**Reason**: "Deferred pending clear business case. Current user demand (2/10) and business value (5/10) insufficient. Re-evaluate when orchestration requirements emerge or user demand increases."

**Re-evaluation Triggers**:
- User demand increases to ‚â•6/10
- Clear business case emerges
- Strategic initiative requires orchestration
- Dependencies from other high-value SDs

---

## Retrospective Notes

### Lessons Learned

1. **Consolidation SDs Need Validation**: Just because features are grouped doesn't mean they should all be built
2. **User Demand Trumps Technical Interest**: 2/10 user demand is a clear signal
3. **Simplicity Gate is Critical**: Prevents building unwanted features
4. **DEFER vs BUILD**: Most deferred features indicate weak SD

### Process Improvements

1. **Earlier Cancellation**: Should have cancelled when 3 of 4 features were deferred
2. **Demand Thresholds**: Set minimum user demand (e.g., ‚â•5/10) for SD approval
3. **Business Case Required**: All SDs need clear user story/business justification

## LEAD Decision

### üéØ OFFICIAL DECISION: CANCEL SD-051

**Approved By**: LEAD Agent (Strategic Leadership Agent)
**Date**: 2025-10-03
**Decision**: CANCEL

**Status Update**:
- Current: active (30% progress)
- New: cancelled
- Progress: Reset to 0% (not applicable)
- Completion: N/A (cancelled)

**Rationale**:
Per LEO Protocol simplicity principle, SD-051 fails to meet minimum thresholds for business value (5/10) and user demand (2/10). Only 25% of original scope remains, indicating weak strategic foundation. Cancelling to prevent waste of 30h on unwanted feature.

**Next Actions**:
1. Update SD-051 status to "cancelled"
2. Generate cancellation retrospective
3. Archive SD-051
4. Document lessons learned
5. Mark as "done done" (cancelled is a completion state)
