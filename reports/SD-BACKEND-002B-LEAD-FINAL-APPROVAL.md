## Outstanding Items (Post-Deployment)

### Not Blocking Approval
1. **UI Integration Testing** - Components created but not tested in browser
2. **Performance Benchmarking** - Company switching <300ms target not measured
3. **Security Penetration Testing** - Chief Security Architect review pending
4. **E2E Test Suite** - Multi-company scenarios not automated
