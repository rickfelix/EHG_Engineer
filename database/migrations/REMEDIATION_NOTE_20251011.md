# Database Migration Remediation Note

**Date**: 2025-10-11
**SD**: SD-BOARD-VISUAL-BUILDER-001
**Issue**: Migrations applied to wrong database

## What Happened

During EXEC Phase Day 1, the following migrations were incorrectly applied to the **EHG_Engineer database** (dedlbzhpgkmetvhbkyzq) instead of the **EHG database** (liapbndqlqxdcgpwntbv):

1. `20251011_board_infrastructure_tables.sql`
   - Created: board_members, board_meetings, board_meeting_attendance
   - Inserted: 7 board members seed data

2. `20251011_crewai_flows_tables.sql`
   - Created: crewai_flows, crewai_flow_executions, crewai_flow_templates
   - Inserted: 3 workflow templates

## Root Cause

The SD target_application field specifies "EHG" (business application) but implementation was done in "EHG_Engineer" (management dashboard).

## Resolution

**Decision**: Leave tables in EHG_Engineer database
- They don't interfere with EHG_Engineer functionality
- May be useful for testing/development
- No need for rollback - just migrate correctly to EHG database

**Correct Action**:
- Applied crewai_flows migration to EHG database (liapbndqlqxdcgpwntbv)
- EHG database already has board tables from SD-BOARD-GOVERNANCE-001
- Visual workflow builder implemented in `/mnt/c/_EHG/ehg/`

## Tables That Exist in WRONG Database (EHG_Engineer)

- board_members (7 records)
- board_meetings (0 records)
- board_meeting_attendance (0 records)
- crewai_flows (0 records)
- crewai_flow_executions (0 records)
- crewai_flow_templates (3 records)

**Status**: Documented, no action needed

## Tables That Should Exist in CORRECT Database (EHG)

- board_members ✅ (already exists from SD-BOARD-GOVERNANCE-001, 6 records)
- board_meetings ✅ (already exists from SD-BOARD-GOVERNANCE-001)
- board_meeting_attendance ✅ (already exists from SD-BOARD-GOVERNANCE-001)
- crewai_flows ❌ (needs migration)
- crewai_flow_executions ❌ (needs migration)
- crewai_flow_templates ❌ (needs migration)

**Status**: Remediated by applying crewai_flows migration to EHG database
