  "executive_summary": "Sprint 2 implementation begins for SD-002 AI Navigation user-facing features. Building on the excellent Sprint 1 foundation (NavigationEngine, SmartNav, telemetry), Sprint 2 focuses on enhanced keyboard shortcuts, accessibility features, and smart search. Foundation achieved 150ms response time target and 87% code coverage. Approved to start Story 2 (Quick Actions) and Story 8 (Accessibility) immediately, with Story 3 (Command Palette) deferred pending UX mockups.",
