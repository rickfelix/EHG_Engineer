### EXEC Phase 1: Database Schema (11%) - COMPLETE
**Duration**: ~30 minutes
**Hours Completed**: 3 out of 28 total
**Progress Contribution**: +5% (35% → 40%)

**Deliverables**:

   - `001_nav_refactor_schema.sql` (Tables, indexes, RLS policies, triggers)
     - nav_routes table (11 columns, 4 indexes)
     - nav_preferences table (7 columns, 1 index, FK to auth.users)
     - RLS policies: Read-all (authenticated), Write-admin (JWT role check)
     - Update triggers: Auto-timestamp on row updates
   - `002_seed_nav_routes.sql` (67 routes from navigationTaxonomy.ts)
     - 11 sections (Core, AI, Analytics, Strategy, Quality, Dev, Security, Knowledge, Collaboration, Portfolio, Operations)
     - All routes seeded with: path, title, description, section, maturity, icon_key, sort_index, badges

2. **Safety Scripts** (Target: `/mnt/c/_EHG/ehg/scripts/`)
   - `export-navigation-backup.mjs` - Backup export utility
   - `apply-nav-refactor-migration.mjs` - Migration orchestrator
   - Backup created: `navigation_backup.json` (67 routes documented)

3. **Documentation**
   - `docs/NAV_REFACTOR_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md` (Comprehensive implementation guide for Phases 2-6)
     - Phase 2: Service Layer (4 hrs) - navigationService.ts, useNavigation hook, TypeScript types
     - Phase 3: UI Components (6 hrs) - MaturityToggle, Navigation refactor, NavigationCategory update

## 🚨 Critical Blockers & Next Actions

### BLOCKER #1: Manual Database Migration Required
**Status**: Pending Developer Action
**Action Required**: Apply migrations via Supabase Dashboard SQL Editor

**Steps**:
1. Open Supabase Dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/liapbndqlqxdcgpwntbv
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Copy & execute: `database/migrations/001_nav_refactor_schema.sql`
4. Copy & execute: `database/migrations/002_seed_nav_routes.sql`
5. Validate: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM nav_routes;` (must return 67)

**Why Blocker**:
- Supabase JavaScript client has limited DDL execution capabilities
- Direct SQL execution via Dashboard required for CREATE TABLE, CREATE POLICY statements
- Migration parity validation cannot proceed until tables exist

**Impact**: Phases 2-6 cannot begin until database schema exists

---

### Next Developer Actions (Priority Order):

1. **IMMEDIATE** (30 mins): Apply database migrations
   - Execute SQL files in Supabase Dashboard
   - Validate route count === 67
   - Test RLS policies (authenticated read, admin write)

3. **PHASE 3** (6 hrs): Build UI Components
   - MaturityToggle component
   - Refactor Navigation.tsx
   - Update NavigationCategory.tsx
   - Test maturity filtering

4. **PHASE 4** (4 hrs): Settings Integration
   - NavigationSettings component
   - AdminRouteTable component
   - Add Navigation tab to /settings

5. **PHASE 5** (5 hrs): Testing & Docs
   - Write E2E tests (Playwright)
   - Write A11y tests (Axe)
   - Create architecture docs

6. **PHASE 6** (2 hrs): Feature Flag Rollout
   - Implement VITE_FEATURE_NEW_NAV toggle
   - Test legacy fallback
   - Gradual rollout plan

7. **VERIFICATION** (Variable): EXEC→PLAN→LEAD
   - Run all tests

## ⚡ Recommendations for Continuation

### For Next Session:
1. **Start with Manual Migration** - Cannot proceed until database tables exist
2. **Follow Implementation Roadmap** - Detailed guide in `docs/NAV_REFACTOR_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md`
3. **Test Incrementally** - After each phase, run tests to catch issues early
4. **Engage Sub-Agents** - Use QA Director, Design Sub-Agent during PLAN verification

### Potential Optimizations:
1. **Use Supabase CLI** - For automated migration execution (vs. manual Dashboard)
2. **Implement Phase 2-3 in Parallel** - Service layer + UI components can be developed concurrently
3. **Early User Testing** - Test MaturityToggle with users before full rollout
4. **Performance Profiling** - Measure navigation render time early in Phase 3

### Risk Mitigations:
1. **RLS Policy Testing** - Test admin/user permissions thoroughly before rollout
2. **Backup Verification** - Ensure navigation_backup.json is complete and valid
3. **Feature Flag Testing** - Test legacy nav fallback extensively before deprecation
4. **Performance Monitoring** - Monitor navigation render time in production
