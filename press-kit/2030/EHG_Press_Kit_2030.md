## Official Biography

### Rick, Chairman of ExecHoldings Global

Rick's journey from solo entrepreneur to pioneering the future of AI-native business governance represents one of the most remarkable transformations in modern business history. Beginning in 2025 as a single individual with a vision, Rick architected the foundational knowledge base that would become EVA, the world's most sophisticated business orchestration AI.

Through relentless iteration and a database-first philosophy, Rick developed the LEO Protocol—a 40-stage venture workflow that transforms ideas into profitable businesses with unprecedented efficiency. By maintaining his role as the only human in an otherwise fully automated system, Rick has redefined corporate governance, proving that human judgment is most valuable when focused exclusively on constitutional oversight, ethical boundaries, and long-term strategic vision.

Today, as Chairman of ExecHoldings Global, Rick oversees a portfolio of 50+ AI-managed ventures, each run by specialized AI CEOs under EVA's orchestration. His signature accomplishment—building the first $100M ARR business empire managed entirely by artificial intelligence—has established him as the foremost authority on AI-native governance and the future of autonomous business operations.

### ExecHoldings Global Surpasses $100M ARR Across Autonomous Ventures
*By Sarah Chen, Senior Editor | September 15, 2030*

**SAN FRANCISCO** — In a milestone that seemed like science fiction just five years ago, ExecHoldings Global (EHG) has officially surpassed $100 million in combined annual recurring revenue across its portfolio of 50+ AI-managed ventures. The achievement marks a turning point not just for EHG, but for the entire concept of corporate structure and management.

At the heart of this revolution is EVA, the Executive Virtual Assistant that has evolved from a simple automation tool into a master orchestrator capable of managing entire businesses autonomously. "EVA doesn't just execute tasks," explains Chairman Rick, the sole human in EHG's operation. "She identifies opportunities, creates strategic directives, builds companies, manages operations, and optimizes performance—all while I focus on the bigger picture: ensuring ethical governance and long-term strategic alignment."

The numbers speak for themselves. Using the proprietary LEO Protocol, a 40-stage venture creation workflow, EHG launches a new profitable venture every 18 days on average. Each venture progresses through stages ranging from ideation and market validation to scaling and potential exit, all managed by specialized AI agents coordinated by EVA. The result is a venture success rate of 73%—nearly 10x the industry average for traditional startups.

What makes EHG's approach truly revolutionary is its radical rethinking of human involvement. While traditional companies struggle with human resource limitations, communication overhead, and decision bottlenecks, EHG operates with perfect information flow and instant decision-making. Rick's role as Chairman is deliberately constrained to constitutional oversight—setting ethical boundaries, approving major strategic pivots, and ensuring the system remains aligned with human values.

"We've proven that the future of business isn't about replacing humans with AI," Rick emphasizes. "It's about elevating human judgment to its highest and best use. I don't manage operations; I govern outcomes. I don't execute tactics; I ensure ethics. This model allows one human to effectively oversee what would traditionally require thousands of employees."

The portfolio's diversity is staggering. From B2B SaaS platforms to digital marketing agencies, from e-commerce operations to fintech solutions, each venture operates independently while benefiting from shared learning and resource optimization orchestrated by EVA. Cross-venture synergies, automatically identified and exploited by EVA's pattern recognition capabilities, have generated an additional $23M in value that wouldn't exist in traditional siloed operations.

Industry observers are taking notice. "What Rick and EVA have built at EHG isn't just impressive—it's inevitable," says Dr. Jennifer Martinez, Director of the Stanford AI Business Lab. "They've demonstrated that AI-native governance isn't a futuristic concept; it's a present reality with proven results. Every major corporation in the world is now asking themselves: how do we compete with this?"

The implications extend beyond pure business metrics. EHG's model has reduced operational costs by 78% compared to traditional companies of similar revenue scale. Environmental impact has been minimized through the elimination of physical offices and commuting. Decision-making speed has increased by orders of magnitude, with strategic pivots executed in hours rather than months.

Looking ahead, Rick and EVA show no signs of slowing down. With plans to double the portfolio to 100+ ventures by 2031 and expand into international markets, EHG is positioning itself not just as a successful company, but as the blueprint for the future of business itself.

"Every revolution starts with someone doing what others said was impossible," Rick reflects. "Five years ago, people said AI could never truly run a business. Today, we're running fifty of them. The question isn't whether AI-native companies will dominate the future—it's how quickly traditional companies will adapt or become obsolete."
