# Analysis Documentation

This directory contains analysis reports, investigations, and technical assessments.

## Purpose

Analysis documents capture:
- **Issue investigations**: Root cause analysis and problem diagnosis
- **System assessments**: Architecture and design evaluations
- **Performance analysis**: Bottleneck identification and optimization opportunities
- **Technical reviews**: Code reviews and quality assessments

## File Naming Convention

```
{TYPE}_{SUBJECT}_{IDENTIFIER}.md
```

**Examples**:
- `AGENT_DATA_INVESTIGATION_REPORT.md` - Agent data system investigation
- `ISSUES_ANALYSIS_SD-PRE-EXEC-ANALYSIS-001.md` - SD-specific issue analysis
- `ROOT_CAUSE_USER_STORY_MAPPING_GAP.md` - Root cause analysis

## Document Types

### Issue Analysis
- Problem description
- Impact assessment
- Root cause identification
- Recommended solutions

### System Assessment
- Current state evaluation
- Architectural review
- Gap analysis
- Improvement recommendations

### Technical Review
- Code quality assessment
- Design pattern evaluation
- Best practice compliance
- Refactoring recommendations

## Creating Analysis Documents

1. **Clear title**: Describes what was analyzed
2. **Context**: Why analysis was needed
3. **Methodology**: How analysis was conducted
4. **Findings**: What was discovered
5. **Recommendations**: Next steps and solutions
6. **Impact**: Priority and effort estimates

## Template Structure
