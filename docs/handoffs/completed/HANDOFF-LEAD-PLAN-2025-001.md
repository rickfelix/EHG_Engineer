## 3. Deliverables Manifest

**DELIVERABLES**

Primary:
- Strategic Directive: `/docs/strategic-directives/SD-2025-001-openai-realtime-voice.md`
- Database Script: `/scripts/add-sd-2025-001-simple.js`

Supporting Documents:
- Research Summary: Incorporated into SD risk assessment
- Cost Analysis: $1,500/month savings documented

Test Artifacts:
- Feasibility validated through 2025 research
- WebRTC approach confirmed viable

## 4. Key Decisions & Rationale

**KEY DECISIONS MADE**

1. **Decision**: Use WebRTC with ephemeral tokens instead of WebSocket
   - **Rationale**: Browser WebSocket cannot set auth headers, WebRTC supports ephemeral tokens
   - **Impact**: Enables secure browser-to-OpenAI connection with 60% lower latency

2. **Decision**: Target gpt-realtime model (not gpt-4o-mini)
   - **Rationale**: 48% better instruction following, 34% better function calling
   - **Impact**: Higher cost but delivers premium experience required for executives

3. **Decision**: Aggressive context management strategy
   - **Rationale**: Real costs are $0.75-$1.00/min without management
   - **Impact**: Keeps costs under $0.50/min target through summarization

4. **Decision**: Consolidate to single interface immediately
   - **Rationale**: Three interfaces create user confusion and technical debt
   - **Impact**: Temporary feature parity risk but cleaner architecture

## 5. Known Issues & Risks

**KNOWN ISSUES**

Critical: 0

Warnings: 2
- **Warning**: Deno WebSocket header limitation
  - **Mitigation**: Use ephemeral token pattern confirmed in research
- **Warning**: 30-minute session timeout
  - **Mitigation**: Implement session handoff with summarization

**RISKS FORWARD**
- **Risk**: Cost overrun if context not managed
  - **Probability**: Medium
  - **Impact**: High
  - **Mitigation**: Implement rolling summarization at 20K tokens

- **Risk**: Voice prompt injection attacks
  - **Probability**: Medium
  - **Impact**: High
  - **Mitigation**: Input classification layer required

## 6. Resource Utilization

**RESOURCE USAGE**
- Context Tokens Used: 56,000 (28% of 200,000 limit)
- Compute Time: 45 minutes
- External Services: OpenAI research, Supabase planning
- Dependencies Added: None

## 7. Handoff Requirements

**ACTION REQUIRED BY PLAN AGENT**

Immediate:
1. Review SD-2025-001 and confirm technical feasibility (within 2 hours)
2. Create PRD-2025-001 with detailed technical specifications (within 4 hours)

Review Required:
1. WebRTC implementation approach for browser client
2. Ephemeral token generation architecture
3. Function calling framework design
4. Context management strategy

Decisions Needed:
1. Specific Supabase Edge Function deployment strategy
2. Audio buffering approach (100ms vs 300ms)
3. Reconnection strategy (exponential backoff parameters)
4. Cost monitoring dashboard implementation

## STRATEGIC CONTEXT FOR TECHNICAL PLANNING

### Business Imperatives
- **Cost Reduction**: $18,000/year savings critical for budget
- **User Experience**: Executives expect <500ms response
- **Intelligence**: Must interpret data, not just read it
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime for mission-critical decisions

### Technical Requirements Overview

**Must Have**:
- WebRTC browser-to-OpenAI connection
- Ephemeral token authentication
- Function calling for portfolio queries
- Context summarization at 20K tokens
- Voice prompt injection defense

**Should Have**:
- Cost monitoring dashboard
- Session handoff mechanism
- Automatic reconnection
- Pre-recorded common responses

**Could Have**:
- Multi-language support
- Custom voice selection
- Conversation export

**Won't Have** (this iteration):
- Video support
- Telephony integration
- Offline mode

### PLAN Agent Specific Instructions

1. **Create PRD-2025-001** with:
   - Complete technical architecture
   - API specifications
   - Security requirements
   - Testing criteria
   - Sub-agent activation requirements

2. **Define Execution Sequences** (EES items):
   - Infrastructure setup
