# User Story Auto-Validation Monitoring Checklist

**Created**: 2025-10-16
**Related SD**: SD-TEST-MOCK-001
**Prevention Mechanism**: auto-validate-user-stories-on-exec-complete.js
**Integration Point**: unified-handoff-system.js (lines 604-619)

---

## Purpose

Monitor the next 3 Strategic Directives to verify the auto-validation prevention mechanism works correctly and prevents the PLAN_verification blocking issue discovered in SD-TEST-MOCK-001.

---

## Root Cause Review

**Issue**: User stories created during PLAN phase were never validated after EXEC completion, blocking PLAN_verification at 0% progress.

**Prevention**: Auto-validation script integrated into unified-handoff-system.js, triggered during EXEC‚ÜíPLAN handoff when all deliverables are complete.

---

## Monitoring Schedule

Track the next 3 SDs that complete EXEC phase (any type: feature, bug fix, documentation, infrastructure).

## Success Criteria

The prevention mechanism is considered **SUCCESSFUL** if:

- ‚úÖ Auto-validation triggers automatically in all 3 SDs
- ‚úÖ User stories are validated when deliverables complete
- ‚úÖ PLAN_verification progress is unblocked (0% ‚Üí 15%)
- ‚úÖ No manual intervention required
- ‚úÖ No PLAN_verification blocking issues occur

The prevention mechanism **NEEDS REFINEMENT** if:

- ‚ùå Auto-validation fails to trigger
- ‚ùå Validation returns errors
- ‚ùå User stories remain 'pending' despite auto-validation
- ‚ùå Manual fixes required for any SD
- ‚ùå PLAN_verification remains blocked

## Verification Commands

Use these commands during monitoring:

**Check user story validation status**:
```sql
SELECT id, title, validation_status, updated_at
FROM user_stories
WHERE sd_id = '<SD-ID>'
ORDER BY created_at;
```

**Check deliverable completion**:
```sql
SELECT deliverable_name, completion_status, created_at
FROM sd_scope_deliverables
WHERE sd_id = '<SD-ID>'
ORDER BY created_at;
```

**Check progress breakdown**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM get_progress_breakdown('<SD-ID>');
```

**Check handoff execution logs**:
```sql
SELECT id, handoff_type, status, validation_details
FROM leo_handoff_executions
WHERE sd_id = '<SD-ID>'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

---

## Edge Cases to Monitor

### Case 1: SD with no user stories
- **Expected**: Auto-validation returns `{ validated: true, count: 0, message: 'No user stories' }`
- **PLAN_verification**: Should not block (no validation requirement if no stories)

### Case 2: User stories already validated
- **Expected**: Auto-validation returns `{ validated: true, count: X, message: 'Already validated' }`
- **PLAN_verification**: Should proceed normally

### Case 3: Deliverables incomplete
- **Expected**: Auto-validation returns `{ validated: false, message: 'Deliverables incomplete' }`
- **PLAN_verification**: Should block until deliverables complete (expected behavior)

### Case 4: Database error during validation
- **Expected**: Auto-validation returns `{ validated: false, error: '[error message]' }`
- **Action**: Investigate database connectivity/permissions
- **Fallback**: Manual validation may be required

## Remediation Plan (If Prevention Fails)

If auto-validation fails for any of the 3 SDs:

1. **Immediate Fix**:
   ```javascript
   node scripts/auto-validate-user-stories-on-exec-complete.js <SD-ID>
   ```

2. **Investigation**:
   - Check unified-handoff-system.js logs for error messages
   - Verify auto-validation function is being called
   - Check user_stories table for validation_status values
   - Review deliverables completion status

3. **Root Cause Analysis**:
   - Was auto-validation triggered? (check console logs)
   - Did it return an error? (check error message)
   - Database schema changes? (check user_stories table)
   - RLS policy blocking? (check Supabase logs)

4. **Fix and Retry**:
   - Apply immediate fix above
   - Update prevention mechanism if needed
   - Document new edge case
   - Retry EXEC‚ÜíPLAN handoff

- [ ] Review all monitoring results
- [ ] Document any edge cases discovered
- [ ] Update auto-validation script if needed
- [ ] Update this checklist with lessons learned
- [ ] Mark prevention mechanism as **PRODUCTION-READY** or **NEEDS-REFINEMENT**
