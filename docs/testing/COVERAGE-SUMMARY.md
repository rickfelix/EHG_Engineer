## TL;DR

- **Current Coverage**: 25% (18/73 endpoints)
- **Critical Gaps**: 26 endpoints (36%) with ZERO coverage
- **Investment Needed**: ~30 hours over 3 sprints
- **Risk Reduction**: HIGH (prevents production failures)

## Top 5 Critical Gaps (Do These First)

| Rank | Feature | Impact | Effort | Test File |
|------|---------|--------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | SDIP Chairman Flow | 🔴 CRITICAL | 3h | `tests/e2e/sdip/chairman-submission-flow.spec.ts` |
| 2 | Venture Artifacts | 🔴 CRITICAL | 2h | `tests/e2e/ventures/artifact-management.spec.ts` |
| 3 | Story Release Gate | 🔴 CRITICAL | 2h | `tests/e2e/stories/release-gate.spec.ts` |
| 4 | AI Engines (3x) | 🔴 CRITICAL | 2h | `tests/e2e/ai-engines/smoke-tests.spec.ts` |
| 5 | Calibration | 🔴 CRITICAL | 1.5h | `tests/e2e/calibration/threshold-calculation.spec.ts` |

**Total Quick Wins**: 10.5 hours → 75% risk reduction

## What's Working Well

✅ **Marketing Distribution API** - 100% coverage (6/6 endpoints)  
✅ **Brand Variants** - 100% coverage  
✅ **Accessibility Testing** - WCAG 2.1 AA compliance  
✅ **Human-Like Testing** - Chaos, LLM UX evaluation  

**Model Test**: `/tests/e2e/api/marketing-distribution.spec.ts`

## What's Missing (High Risk)

❌ **Chairman Journey** - 0% coverage (SDIP 7-step flow)  
❌ **AI Engines** - 0% coverage (Naming, Financial, Content)  
❌ **Competitor Analysis** - 0% coverage (scraping, LLM analysis)  
❌ **Testing Campaign** - 0% coverage (orchestration)  
❌ **WebSocket Real-Time** - 0% coverage (dashboard updates)
