```tsx
// Strong component structure found in EVAVoiceAssistant.tsx
const EVAVoiceAssistant: React.FC<EVAVoiceAssistantProps> = ({
  userId, onTranscript, onFunctionCall, onCostUpdate, onError
}) => {
  // Clean state management with proper typing
  const [isConnected, setIsConnected] = useState(false);
  const [conversation, setConversation] = useState<ConversationItem[]>([]);
  // ...proper refs and effect handling
}
```

### 2. Voice Interface User Experience ❌

**Assessment**: Basic functionality present but lacks comprehensive UX design

**Critical Issues**:
- No visual indicators for different voice states (processing, thinking, speaking)
- Limited user feedback during WebRTC connection phases
- Missing voice interaction tutorials or onboarding
- No voice command discovery mechanism
- Conversation history UX is minimal chat-style implementation

**UX Flow Score**: 5.0/10

<button
  onClick={isConnected ? disconnect : connect}
  // MISSING: aria-label, role, aria-describedby
  // MISSING: keyboard event handlers
  // MISSING: focus management
>
  {isConnected ? 'Disconnect' : 'Connect'}
</button>

// Should be:
<button
  onClick={isConnected ? disconnect : connect}
  onKeyDown={handleKeyPress}
  aria-label={isConnected ? 'Disconnect from voice assistant' : 'Connect to voice assistant'}
  aria-describedby="voice-status"
  role="button"
  tabIndex={0}
>
```

### 4. Responsive Design Assessment ⚠️

**Assessment**: Partial responsive design with mobile limitations

**Responsive Analysis**:
- **Tailwind CSS**: Proper responsive utility classes in use
- **Breakpoints**: Standard responsive breakpoints defined (xs: 475px, sm: 640px, md: 768px)
- **Layout**: Components use responsive grid patterns
- **Typography**: Responsive text sizing implemented

**Mobile-Specific Issues**:
- Voice controls may be difficult to tap on mobile (touch targets)
- Conversation display height fixed at 264px (not mobile-optimized)
- No mobile-specific voice interaction patterns
- Missing haptic feedback integration for mobile devices

**Responsive Score**: 6.5/10

**CSS Responsive Strengths**:
```css
/* Good responsive patterns found */
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .dashboard-card {
    @apply p-4; /* Reduced padding on mobile */
  }
  .grid-responsive {
    @apply grid-cols-1; /* Single column on mobile */
  }
}
```

### 5. Design System Consistency ✅
