## Testing Procedure

### Setup
1. Start the application: `npm run dev`
2. Open browser console to monitor function calls
3. Click "Start Voice Conversation"
4. Wait for "Listening..." indicator

### For Each Test Query
1. **Speak clearly** - Articulate the query
2. **Monitor console** for:
   - üîß Function call requested
   - üì¶ Function arguments
   - üî® Executing function
   - ‚úÖ Function result
   - üì§ Function result sent back
3. **Listen to response** - Verify it matches the data
4. **Check for errors** in console

### Console Output Examples

**Successful Function Call:**
```
üîß Function call requested: get_portfolio_summary
üì¶ Function arguments: {"include_metrics": true}
üî® Executing function: get_portfolio_summary
‚úÖ Function result received
üì§ Function result sent back to OpenAI
```

**Failed Function Call:**
```
üîß Function call requested: get_companies
‚ùå Function execution failed: Network error
```

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Function Not Triggered
**Symptoms:** Query spoken but no function called
**Solutions:**
1. Rephrase query more explicitly
2. Check WebSocket connection status
3. Verify function definitions are loaded
4. Review OpenAI console for model decisions

### Wrong Function Called
**Symptoms:** Different function executed than expected
**Solutions:**
1. Improve function descriptions
2. Make query more specific
3. Check for overlapping function purposes
4. Review function parameter requirements

### Function Execution Fails
**Symptoms:** Function called but returns error
**Solutions:**
1. Check authentication (JWT token)
2. Verify database permissions
3. Check Edge Function logs
4. Test query directly in SQL editor

### No Voice Response
**Symptoms:** Function executes but no audio response
**Solutions:**
1. Check WebSocket still connected
2. Verify response.create was sent
3. Check audio output device
4. Monitor for audio stream events

## Performance Benchmarks

Expected response times:
- Function recognition: < 500ms
- Database query: 100-500ms
- Response generation: 200-400ms
- Total end-to-end: < 2 seconds

## Advanced Testing

### Compound Queries
Test multiple functions in sequence:
- "How many active ventures do I have and what tasks are pending?"
- "Search for AI projects and show me their metrics"
- "Create a note about this and show me recent activity"

### Error Recovery
Test error handling:
- Ask about non-existent data
- Request invalid date ranges
- Try creating items with missing info

### Context Switching
Test maintaining context:
- Ask follow-up questions
- Reference previous responses
- Request clarifications

## Notes for Developers

### Adding New Test Cases
1. Identify the target function
2. Create natural language variations
3. Define expected parameters
4. Document expected response format
5. Add to appropriate category above

### Monitoring Production Usage
- Track which functions are called most
- Identify common query patterns
- Find queries that fail to trigger functions
- Optimize function descriptions based on usage

### Continuous Improvement
- Regularly review OpenAI's function call decisions
- Update descriptions for better recognition
- Add new functions based on user needs
- Refine parameter extraction logic
