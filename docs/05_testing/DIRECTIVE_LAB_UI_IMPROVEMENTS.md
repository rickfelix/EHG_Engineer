- Performs real-time UI analysis
- Tests across multiple viewports
- Validates accessibility with axe-core
- Measures performance metrics
- Tests interactive elements
- Generates detailed reports

## Implementation Status

### Completed Tasks:
- âœ… Created unified component library
- âœ… Established design token system
- âœ… Built 3 core UI components
- âœ… Created enhanced DirectiveLab implementation
- âœ… Fixed mobile navigation issues
- âœ… Added comprehensive accessibility features
- âœ… Created Playwright testing tool

### Files Created:
1. `/lib/dashboard/client/components/ui/Button.jsx`
2. `/lib/dashboard/client/components/ui/Input.jsx`
3. `/lib/dashboard/client/components/ui/ProgressBar.jsx`
4. `/lib/dashboard/client/components/ui/design-tokens.css`
5. `/lib/dashboard/client/components/DirectiveLabEnhanced.jsx`
6. `/scripts/design-playwright-analyzer.js`

## Next Steps for Integration

1. **Replace existing DirectiveLab.jsx with DirectiveLabEnhanced.jsx**:
   ```bash
   cp DirectiveLabEnhanced.jsx DirectiveLab.jsx
   ```

2. **Import design tokens in main CSS**:
   ```css
   @import './components/ui/design-tokens.css';
   ```

3. **Update other components** to use the new Button and Input components

4. **Run Playwright analyzer** to verify improvements:
   ```bash
   node scripts/design-playwright-analyzer.js
   ```
