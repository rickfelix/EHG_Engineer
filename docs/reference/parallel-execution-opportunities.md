# Parallel Execution Opportunities for Claude Code

**Status**: ACTIVE
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-12
**Evidence**: Identified from SD-SETTINGS-2025-10-12 analysis

## Overview

Claude Code supports parallel tool execution for independent operations. This guide identifies opportunities to reduce latency by executing multiple operations simultaneously when there are no dependencies between them.

## Core Principle

**Execute in parallel when operations are independent. Execute sequentially when operations have dependencies.**

## Missed Opportunities in SD-SETTINGS-2025-10-12

### 1. Component File Reading (Sequential → Should be Parallel)

**What Happened**:
```typescript
// Sequential execution (what we did)
Read('src/components/settings/GeneralSettings.tsx');
// Wait for result...
Read('src/components/settings/DatabaseSettings.tsx');
// Wait for result...
Read('src/components/settings/IntegrationSettings.tsx');
// Wait for result...
```

**Time Taken**: 6-9 seconds (2-3s per read operation)

**Better Approach**:
```typescript
// Parallel execution (what we should do)
[
  Read('src/components/settings/GeneralSettings.tsx'),
  Read('src/components/settings/DatabaseSettings.tsx'),
  Read('src/components/settings/IntegrationSettings.tsx')
]
```

**Time Saved**: 4-6 seconds (all complete in 2-3s total)

**Rationale**: These are independent files with no dependencies

---

### 2. Line Count Verification (Sequential → Should be Parallel)

**What Happened**:
```bash
# Sequential execution
Bash('wc -l GeneralSettings.tsx')
Bash('wc -l DatabaseSettings.tsx')
Bash('wc -l IntegrationSettings.tsx')
Bash('wc -l SystemConfiguration.tsx')
```

**Time Taken**: 4-8 seconds (1-2s per command)

**Better Approach**:
```bash
# Single command with multiple files
Bash('wc -l GeneralSettings.tsx DatabaseSettings.tsx IntegrationSettings.tsx SystemConfiguration.tsx')
```

**Time Saved**: 3-6 seconds (all LOC in one command)

**Rationale**: `wc` can process multiple files in a single invocation

---

### 3. Pre-Implementation Verification (Sequential → Could be Parallel)

**What Happened**:
```bash
# Sequential execution
Bash('cd /mnt/c/_EHG/ehg && pwd')
Bash('git remote -v')
Bash('lsof -i :5173')
```

**Time Taken**: 3-6 seconds

**Better Approach**:
```bash
# Parallel execution
[
  Bash('cd /mnt/c/_EHG/ehg && pwd'),
  Bash('git remote -v'),
  Bash('lsof -i :5173')
]
```

**Time Saved**: 2-4 seconds

**Rationale**: These are independent verification checks

---

## Safe Parallel Execution Patterns

### File Reading

#### ✅ Safe for Parallel

```typescript
// Reading multiple independent files for analysis
[
  Read('src/components/Component1.tsx'),
  Read('src/components/Component2.tsx'),
  Read('src/types/types.ts'),
  Read('tests/component.test.tsx')
]
```

**Rationale**: Reading doesn't modify state, files don't depend on each other

#### ❌ NOT Safe for Parallel

```typescript
// Reading where second depends on first
Read('config.json');  // Need to parse this first
// ... analyze config to determine which component to read
Read('src/components/DynamicComponent.tsx');  // Depends on config content
```

**Rationale**: Second read depends on content of first

---

### Git Operations

#### ✅ Safe for Parallel

```typescript
// Multiple read-only Git commands
[
  Bash('git status'),
  Bash('git log -1'),
  Bash('git diff HEAD'),
  Bash('git remote -v')
]
```

**Rationale**: All are read-only queries

#### ❌ NOT Safe for Parallel

```typescript
// Write operations
Bash('git add .');
Bash('git commit -m "..."');
Bash('git push');
```

**Rationale**: Each depends on the previous completing successfully

---

### Database Queries

#### ✅ Safe for Parallel

```typescript
// Reading from independent tables
[
  supabase.from('strategic_directives_v2').select('id, title').eq('id', 'SD-XXX'),
  supabase.from('product_requirements_v2').select('id, title').eq('strategic_directive_id', 'SD-XXX'),
  supabase.from('user_stories').select('id, title').eq('strategic_directive_id', 'SD-XXX')
]
```

**Rationale**: Read-only queries on independent tables

#### ❌ NOT Safe for Parallel

```typescript
// Write operations across tables
await supabase.from('strategic_directives_v2').update({status: 'active'}).eq('id', 'SD-XXX');
await supabase.from('product_requirements_v2').insert({strategic_directive_id: 'SD-XXX', ...});
```

**Rationale**: Second operation depends on first completing (foreign key)

---

### Test Execution

#### ⚠️ Conditionally Safe for Parallel

```typescript
// Different test types (if they fit in context budget)
[
  Bash('npm run test:unit --no-coverage'),
  Bash('npm run test:a11y')
]
```

**Rationale**: Independent test suites, but both produce large output

**Caution**: Only if combined output < 30K tokens

#### ❌ NOT Safe for Parallel

```typescript
// Tests that depend on build
Bash('npm run build');
Bash('npm run test:e2e');  // Depends on build completing
```

**Rationale**: E2E tests require built artifacts

---

### Sub-Agent Execution

#### ✅ Safe for Parallel (RECOMMENDED)

```bash
# LEAD Pre-Approval: Multiple independent assessments
node scripts/systems-analyst-codebase-audit.js SD-XXX &
node scripts/database-architect-schema-review.js SD-XXX &
node scripts/security-architect-assessment.js SD-XXX &
node scripts/design-subagent-evaluation.js SD-XXX &
wait
```

**Rationale**: Each sub-agent evaluates different aspects independently

**Time Saved**: 1-1.5 minutes (4 sub-agents in 30s vs 2min sequential)

#### ❌ NOT Safe for Parallel

```bash
# Sequential dependencies
node scripts/database-architect-schema-review.js SD-XXX  # Must complete first
node scripts/security-architect-assessment.js SD-XXX  # Needs schema review results
```

**Rationale**: Security assessment depends on schema review findings

---

## Decision Matrix

| Operation | Parallel? | Rationale | Time Saved |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| **Read multiple files** | ✅ YES | Independent, read-only | 2-3s per file after first |
| **Write multiple files** | ❌ NO | Need to verify each succeeds | N/A (correctness matters) |
| **Multiple git status commands** | ✅ YES | Read-only queries | 1-2s per command after first |
| **Git add/commit/push** | ❌ NO | Sequential dependencies | N/A (must be sequential) |
| **Database reads from different tables** | ✅ YES | Independent queries | 1-2s per query after first |
| **Database writes** | ❌ NO | May have foreign key deps | N/A (correctness matters) |
| **Sub-agent execution** | ✅ YES | Independent assessments | 1-2min (parallel vs sequential) |
| **Test suite + build** | ❌ NO | Tests depend on build | N/A (tests need built code) |
| **Independent test suites** | ⚠️ MAYBE | If context budget allows | 1-2min (if both fit in budget) |

## Implementation Guidelines

### When to Use Parallel Execution

**Ask these questions**:
1. Are the operations independent (no shared state)?
2. Does operation B need the result of operation A?
3. Will parallel execution save significant time (>2 seconds)?
4. Is the combined output manageable (<30K tokens)?

**If YES to 1, 3, 4 and NO to 2** → Use parallel execution

### How to Implement

**Claude Code Native Parallel**:
```typescript
// Send multiple tool calls in a single message
<function_calls>
<invoke name="Read">
<parameter name="file_path">/path/to/file1.tsx
