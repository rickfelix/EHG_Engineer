## Executive Summary

This comprehensive research report addresses the strategic dilemma facing EHG, a venture factory operating under the constraints of a solo operator model while managing the inception of multiple digital ventures across diverse jurisdictions (US, UK, EU, AU). The core inquiry is whether EHG should capitalize on its central position to build an internal Legal Document Generator or whether this function is best outsourced to the burgeoning legal technology market.

The analysis evaluates the proposition through four critical lenses: Operational Feasibility (Can a solo operator maintain it?), Liability Exposure (What happens when a document fails?), Economic Efficiency (Build vs. Buy ROI), and Competitive Differentiation (Does this add unique value?).

The legal technology landscape has fundamentally shifted in the last five years, bifurcating into two distinct categories:

1. **Static Agreements** (Terms of Service, Sales Contracts, NDAs): These are increasingly commoditized and standardized by industry bodies like Y Combinator and Common Paper.
2. **Dynamic Compliance Documents** (Privacy Policies, Cookie Policies): These have transformed from static text into dynamic software services that must react in real-time to user geography and evolving legislation (GDPR, CCPA, ePrivacy).

### Key Findings

**The "Build" Trap**: Developing a custom generator (Option C or D) is economically irrational. The initial build cost is deceptively low, but the maintenance burden of tracking global regulatory changes for a solo operator is catastrophic. Furthermore, the liability risk of "Unauthorized Practice of Law" (UPL) and the technical risk of LLM hallucinations (Option D) present existential threats to the studio.

**The "Buy" Reality**: The market offers "Agency" and "Reseller" solutions (Option E) specifically designed for venture builders. These solutions (e.g., GetTerms, Iubenda) offer indemnification, automatic updates, and white-labeling for a fraction of the cost of building.

**The "Standard" Advantage**: For commercial contracts, the industry has moved away from bespoke templates toward open standards (Option B). Using standardized docs like Common Paper accelerates B2B sales cycles, whereas a custom EHG-generated contract might introduce friction.

### Verdict

The report recommends a **Hybrid Outsourcing Strategy**. EHG should SKIP building internal tools. Instead, it should PARTNER with a compliance vendor (e.g., GetTerms or Termly) for dynamic policies and CURATE a library of open-standard templates (Common Paper/YC) for static contracts. This approach minimizes liability, reduces operational overhead to near zero, and provides portfolio companies with "Lawyer-Grade" compliance from Day 1.

## 1. Problem Validation: The Venture Factory's "Legal Debt" Dilemma

### 1.1 The Context of "Legal Debt" in Venture Creation

In the high-velocity environment of a venture factory, every new "Spin-out" or "Newco" incurs immediate "legal debt." To operate legitimately, process payments, and acquire users, a nascent digital venture requires a foundational legal stack. This stack is not merely administrative; it is the interface between the venture, its users, and the regulatory state.

The core documents required include:

- **Terms of Service (ToS)**: The contractual basis of the user relationship, defining liability limits and acceptable use.
- **Privacy Policy**: A mandatory regulatory disclosure of data handling practices, required by GDPR (EU), CCPA (California), and others.
- **Cookie Policy**: A specific requirement of the EU ePrivacy Directive and increasingly relevant in US state laws.
- **Data Processing Agreement (DPA)**: Essential for B2B SaaS ventures selling into enterprises or operating across borders.

For early-stage ventures, these documents often represent friction. Founders frequently view them as bureaucratic hurdles rather than strategic assets. However, the absence or inadequacy of these documents creates immediate "blocking" events in the venture lifecycle:

- **Payment Gateway Rejection**: Financial infrastructure providers like Stripe, PayPal, and merchant banks require visible, compliant ToS and Privacy Policies during the underwriting process. Failure to provide these can lead to account suspension or funds being frozen.
- **App Store Rejection**: Both the Apple App Store and Google Play mandate valid privacy policy URLs for app submission. This is a binary "pass/fail" gate; without a valid policy, the product cannot launch.
- **B2B Sales Friction**: Enterprise customers often refuse to sign contracts without a valid DPA and clear Terms of Service. Using a generic template can kill a deal when a prospective client's legal team redlines a poorly drafted document.

### 1.2 Founder Pain Points: Perception vs. Reality

Research into founder behavior indicates a dichotomy in how legal documentation is perceived versus its actual risk profile.

**The "Check-the-Box" Mentality**

For pre-revenue B2C startups, founders often engage in "cargo cult" compliance—copying and pasting policies from competitors or using generic templates found online. This approach stems from a belief that "nobody reads the Terms of Service" and that legal risks are remote for small companies. While statistically true that small startups are rarely sued for their ToS, the perception of low risk leads to the accumulation of latent liability.

- **The Reality Gap**: A copied privacy policy often promises data handling practices (e.g., "We do not sell data") that the startup inadvertently violates by installing a Facebook Pixel (which can be legally construed as "selling" data under CCPA).
- **The Founder's Desire**: Founders want the problem to "go away" with zero effort. They do not want to become legal experts. They prioritize speed and approval (e.g., passing Stripe verification) over legal robustness.

**The "B2B Friction" Reality**

For B2B ventures, the pain is more acute. A generic template is often insufficient for closing deals with mid-market or enterprise clients.

- **Procurement Blockers**: Corporate procurement departments have checklists. If a venture's DPA is missing the standard clauses required by GDPR (Article 28), the deal stalls.
- **Negotiation Fatigue**: Founders spending time negotiating basic ToS clauses are not spending time selling the product.

### 1.3 Is This a "Hair on Fire" Problem?

Is the lack of a document generator a "hair on fire" problem for founders? The evidence suggests it is not. It is a **"Table Stakes"** problem.

- **Table Stakes**: It is a requirement to play the game, but doing it "better" than competitors yields marginal returns. A venture does not win customers because its Privacy Policy is beautifully formatted; it loses customers if the policy is missing.
- **Implication for EHG**: If EHG builds a generator, it is solving a low-value hygiene problem. The founders will appreciate the speed, but they will not value the uniqueness of the solution. They just want the box checked.
- **The "Distraction" Risk**: For EHG as a solo operator, every hour spent maintaining a legal tool is an hour not spent on product validation, recruitment, or fundraising—activities that actually drive venture success.

### 1.4 The "Unfair Advantage" Question

Does EHG have an unfair advantage in building this?

**Answer: No.** EHG is a solo operator without a dedicated legal engineering team. Companies like Termly and Iubenda have dozens of lawyers and engineers dedicated solely to keeping these documents up to date. EHG cannot compete with this scale.

**Conclusion**: EHG's problem is procurement, not production. The goal should be to provide access to best-in-class tools, not to reinvent them.

## 2. Competitive and Peer Analysis: What Do the Leaders Do?

To determine the industry standard for venture support, we analyzed the legal infrastructure strategies of major venture builders, accelerators, and legal tech incumbents. This "Peer Analysis" reveals that building internal generators is a strategy almost universally rejected by top-tier organizations.

### 2.1 Y Combinator (YC): The "Open Standard" Strategist

Y Combinator is the gold standard for early-stage acceleration. Their approach to legal infrastructure is instructive.

**Strategy**: Open Standards & Standardization (Option B).

- **The SAFE**: YC realized that bespoke convertible note drafting was a friction point. Instead of building a "Note Generator," they created the SAFE (Simple Agreement for Future Equity)—a static, open-source standard that the entire industry adopted.
- **Series A Term Sheet**: YC publishes a standard term sheet to educate founders, effectively setting the market norm.
- **Sales Agreements**: YC promotes the Common Paper standard for cloud service agreements. They explicitly direct founders to use these third-party standards rather than providing a "YC Legal Bot".
- **Incorporation**: YC directs founders to Clerky or Stripe Atlas. Even YC, with its immense resources, does not attempt to build an internal incorporation tool. They rely on trusted partners.

**Insight for EHG**: YC chooses Standardization over Automation. They reduce friction by creating market consensus on what the document should say, rather than building software to write it. They focus on high-leverage documents (fundraising equity) and outsource the commoditized ones (incorporation/privacy).

### 2.2 Techstars: The "Perks Marketplace" Model

Techstars operates a vast network of accelerators globally. Their approach differs slightly but adheres to the same "Buy/Partner" philosophy.

**Strategy**: Perks & Partner Networks (Option F).

- **Mechanism**: Techstars leverages its aggregate purchasing power to negotiate deep discounts for portfolio companies. Their "Perks" page lists credits for services like Legalpad (for visas), Clerky, and Cooley GO.
- **Investment Structure**: Like YC, they use standard equity documents but expect founders to engage external counsel for substantive legal work. They facilitate access to a "mentor network" of lawyers rather than trying to replace the lawyer with software.

**Insight for EHG**: Techstars treats legal support as a "Perk"—a financial subsidy for external services—rather than an internal product capability.

### 2.3 Antler: The "Global Localization" Specialist

Antler operates in 27+ locations, facing the same multi-jurisdictional challenges as EHG (US, UK, EU, AU, etc.).

**Strategy**: Curated Partnerships (Option E).

- **Mechanism**: Because a privacy policy in Singapore differs vastly from one in Berlin, Antler partners with local top-tier law firms in each jurisdiction (e.g., Mintz in the US). They rely on these partners to provide "office hours" and localized templates.
- **Why Not Build?**: The complexity of maintaining compliance across 27 jurisdictions would require a massive internal legal-engineering team. Antler recognizes this is non-core to their business of finding founders.

### 2.4 The Incumbents: Stripe Atlas & Clerky

These are the services EHG would be competing against if it chose Option C (Build).

- **Stripe Atlas**: Built by Stripe (a fintech giant), Atlas focuses on the "Happy Path" of incorporation—Delaware C-Corp, standard bylaws, EIN acquisition. It is a "Factory" model optimized for speed and banking integration.
- **Clerky**: Built by startup lawyers, Clerky focuses on "Lawyer-Grade" paper trails. It is the preferred choice for companies with complex cap tables or those following the specific YC legal framework.

### Competitive Landscape Summary

| Organization | Strategy | Primary Mechanism | Relevance to EHG |
|--------------|----------|-------------------|------------------|
| Y Combinator | Standardization | SAFE, Common Paper, Clerky Referral | Model to Follow: Use standards for contracts. |
| Techstars | Perks/Discounts | Partner Credits (Legalpad, etc.) | Model to Follow: Use purchasing power for discounts. |
| Antler | Localization | Law Firm Partnerships | Warning: Multi-jurisdiction requires local experts. |
| Stripe Atlas | Productization | Internal "Factory" Tool | Warning: Only viable with massive scale/resources. |

**Key Takeaway**: The market leaders in venture building universally choose Option B (Templates) or Option E (Partners). None attempt Option C (Internal Build) for ongoing compliance docs because the maintenance-to-value ratio is unfavorable. EHG should not attempt to out-build Stripe or Clerky.

## 3. Evaluation of Strategic Options

### 3.1 Option A: Skip Entirely (The "Hands-Off" Approach)

**Description**: EHG provides no tools or templates. Founders are told, "Legal is your responsibility."

**Pros**:
- Zero Liability: EHG cannot be sued for bad docs it didn't provide.
- Zero Cost: No development or subscription fees.

**Cons**:
- Inconsistent Quality: Some ventures will hire expensive lawyers; others will copy-paste bad templates. This creates "due diligence debt" that EHG (as an equity holder) will eventually have to clean up before an exit or Series A.
- Founder Friction: Increases the burden on the founder, slowing down launch velocity.

**Verdict**: Reject. While low-risk, it fails the "Venture Factory" promise of accelerating the startup journey.

### 3.2 Option B: Curated Template Library (The "YC/Common Paper" Approach)

**Description**: EHG hosts an internal portal with links to vetted, open-source standards.

- Contracts: Links to Common Paper for MSAs, DPAs, and NDAs.
- Fundraising: Links to YC SAFE.
- Employment: Links to Cooley GO.

**Pros**:
- High Quality: Docs are vetted by top firms (Cooley, Goodwin, etc.).
- Zero Maintenance: The providers update the standards.
- Industry Signal: Using standard forms signals maturity to investors and partners.

**Cons**:
- Privacy Gap: Static templates work poorly for Privacy Policies and Cookie Policies, which need to be dynamic based on the specific tracking technologies used (e.g., "Do you use AdRoll?").

**Verdict**: Strong Strategy for Contracts (Static Docs), but insufficient for Compliance (Dynamic Docs).

### 3.3 Option C: Template Fill-In Wizard (The "Internal Tool" Approach)

**Description**: EHG builds a React/Node app. Founders answer a questionnaire ("Do you use cookies?"), and the system injects clauses into a template.

**Economic Reality**:
- Build: ~160 hours of dev time @ $100/hr = $16,000.
- Maintenance: Legislative changes (e.g., new US state privacy laws) require constant code updates.
- Liability Risk: High. If the logic fails (e.g., the wizard fails to insert the "Sale of Data" opt-out link required by CCPA), EHG is the "author" of the defect and potentially liable for the venture's fines.

**Verdict**: Reject. This is the "Tar Pit." It looks simple but requires EHG to become a legal-tech maintenance shop.

### 3.4 Option D: LLM-Assisted Generation (The "AI" Approach)

**Description**: Use OpenAI/Anthropic APIs to "Generate a privacy policy for a fintech app in London."

**The "Hallucination" Risk**:
- LLMs are probabilistic, not deterministic. They are prone to "hallucinations"—inventing facts or laws.
- Case Study: In Mata v. Avianca, lawyers were sanctioned for submitting court filings generated by ChatGPT that cited non-existent cases.
- Regulatory Backlash: DoNotPay (the "Robot Lawyer") faced FTC enforcement and class-action lawsuits for practicing law without a license and overpromising results. The FTC explicitly warned against "AI Lawyer" claims that cannot be substantiated.
- Liability: If an EHG-provided AI tool generates a hallucinated clause (e.g., referencing a defunct "Safe Harbor" instead of the "Data Privacy Framework"), the liability blowback on EHG would be severe.

**Verdict**: Reject. The technology is not yet mature enough for unreviewed legal generation, and the liability is existential.

### 3.5 Option E: Partner/Integrate (The "Reseller" Approach)

**Description**: Purchase an "Agency" license from a specialized vendor (Termly, GetTerms, Iubenda). EHG creates sub-accounts for each venture.

**Pros**:
- Liability Shift: The vendor takes responsibility for keeping the policies up to date with the law.
- Dynamic Compliance: These tools include "Cookie Scanners" and "Consent Banners" that static templates cannot provide.
- Cost Efficiency: Agency packs reduce the per-venture cost to ~$5-10/month.

**Cons**:
- Recurring Cost: It is not free (unlike Option A/B).

**Verdict**: Optimal Strategy for Compliance Docs. It solves the dynamic nature of privacy laws without internal maintenance.

### 3.6 Option F: Attorney Network (The "Boutique" Approach)

**Description**: Negotiate a flat-rate "Startup Package" ($1k-$2k) with a partner law firm.

**Pros**: Highest quality, zero liability for EHG.

**Cons**: Too Expensive for the "Zero to One" stage. Bootstrapped ventures cannot afford $2k for docs before they have revenue.

**Verdict**: Retain as an "Upgrade" path for ventures that reach Series A scale, but not for day one.

---

## 4. Liability and Risk Assessment: The "Unauthorized Practice of Law" (UPL)

A critical constraint for EHG is liability. Can a non-lawyer (EHG) provide legal documents to a third party (the Venture)?

### 4.1 The "Scrivener" Exception vs. UPL

In the US and many jurisdictions, UPL laws prohibit non-lawyers from providing "personalized legal advice."

**The Line**: Providing a blank template is generally legal (it's like selling a book). However, asking specific questions ("Are you a marketplace?") and then selecting specific clauses based on those answers can be construed as practicing law because it involves legal judgment.

**LegalZoom Precedent**: Companies like LegalZoom have survived UPL lawsuits by carefully arguing they act only as "scriveners"—recording the user's choices into a template without exercising judgment. They explicitly state they are not a law firm.

**The Risk for EHG (Option C)**: If EHG builds a wizard that makes choices for the user (e.g., "We detected you are in California, so we applied CCPA settings"), EHG is exercising judgment. This crosses the line into UPL. If the document is defective, EHG could be sued for malpractice or negligence.

### 4.2 The "DoNotPay" Warning

The case of DoNotPay is a cautionary tale for Option D (LLM). The company marketed itself as "The World's First Robot Lawyer."

- **Consequence**: They faced a class-action lawsuit and an FTC settlement ($193,000) for making unsubstantiated claims about the AI's ability to replace human lawyers.
- **Lesson**: EHG must never present its tools as "AI Legal Advice." Outsourcing to a vendor (Option E) allows EHG to avoid making any claims about the legal validity of the docs, shifting that burden to the vendor's Terms of Service.

### 4.3 Disclaimer Efficacy

Can EHG just add a disclaimer: "This is not legal advice"?

- **Enforceability**: Disclaimers are necessary but not sufficient. Courts often look at the nature of the relationship. If EHG is a venture builder with a fiduciary or equity relationship with the venture, the founder has a "reasonable expectation" that EHG's tools are valid.
- **Browsewrap vs. Clickwrap**: A disclaimer buried in a footer ("Browsewrap") is often unenforceable. It must be a "Clickwrap" agreement where the user affirmatively checks a box.

**Conclusion**: A disclaimer will not protect EHG if EHG actively built a defective tool. It is safer to rely on a third-party vendor whose entire business model is built around indemnification and UPL compliance.

### 4.4 Insurance Implications

- **E&O Insurance**: EHG likely carries Errors & Omissions (E&O) insurance. However, standard E&O policies for software companies typically exclude legal services. If EHG is found to be providing legal services (via a generator), the insurance claim could be denied.
- **Vendor Insurance**: Vendors like Termly and Iubenda carry their own liability insurance for their products. Using them keeps EHG's risk profile clean.

---

## 5. Multi-Jurisdictional Complexity: Why "One Template" Fails

EHG operates in the US, UK, EU, and AU. This creates a matrix of conflicting requirements that makes Option C (Build) technically infeasible for a solo operator.

### 5.1 The "Cookie" Divergence: Opt-In vs. Opt-Out

- **US (CCPA/CPRA)**: Generally follows an "Opt-out" model. You can drop cookies immediately but must offer a "Do Not Sell My Personal Information" link.
- **EU/UK (GDPR/ePrivacy)**: Follows a strict "Opt-in" model. You cannot drop non-essential cookies until the user affirmatively clicks "Accept".

**The Technical Problem**: A static HTML template cannot solve this. You need a dynamic Consent Management Platform (CMP) that detects the user's IP address (Geo-IP) and serves the correct banner (Opt-in for London, Opt-out for New York).

**Build Complexity**: Building a Geo-IP aware CMP script is a complex engineering task involving database maintenance of IP ranges and consent logging (required for audit trails).

### 5.2 Privacy Policy Nuances

- **GDPR (Article 13/14)**: Requires identifying a "Legal Basis" for processing (Consent, Contract, Legitimate Interest) and listing Data Protection Officer (DPO) contact info.
- **CCPA (California)**: Requires specific disclosures about the "Sale" of data and a list of "Categories of Personal Information" collected in the last 12 months.
- **Australia (Privacy Act 1988)**: Has unique "Australian Privacy Principles" (APPs) regarding cross-border disclosure.

**Reality Check**: A "universal template" is a myth. A valid policy must dynamically swap clauses based on the user's location and the venture's specific stack (e.g., "Do you use Stripe?"). Vendors like Iubenda have built engines with 2,000+ clauses to handle this. Replicating this logic is not a "weekend project" for a solo operator; it is a full-time product.

## 6. Build vs. Buy Economics

This section models the costs for supporting 20 ventures over a 3-year period.

### 6.1 The Cost to Build (Option C - Custom Wizard)

**Development Labor**:
- Senior React/Node Developer: ~$100/hr (blended rate for Western/Eastern Europe mix).
- Time to build: Questionnaire wizard, database schema, PDF generation, auth, basic logic. Conservative estimate: 160 hours (4 weeks).
- Initial Dev Cost: 160 hrs * $100/hr = $16,000.

**Legal Engineering**:
- You cannot self-draft the templates. You must hire a lawyer to draft the "Master Clauses" and the logic tree.
- Legal Fees: $5,000 - $10,000 (Conservative).

**Maintenance**:
- Software updates + Regulatory updates (monitoring law changes).
- Estimate: 10 hours/month @ $100/hr equivalent value.
- $1,000/mo * 36 months = $36,000.

**Total 3-Year Cost (Build)**: ~$57,000 - $62,000.
**Cost Per Venture**: ~$3,000.

### 6.2 The Cost to Buy (Option E - Agency Partner)

**GetTerms.io Agency Pack**:
- Agency pricing allows for bulk licenses.
- Business Tier (supports GDPR/CCPA): ~$8/month per site.
- Agency Discount: Typically 30-40% for bulk. Let's assume $5/site/mo.
- 20 Ventures * $5 * 36 months = $3,600.

**Iubenda Agency Plan**:
- Volume discounts kick in >25 sites. Approximate cost ~$5-7/mo per site.
- Total 3-Year Cost: ~$4,000 - $5,000.

**Termly Agency**:
- Custom pricing, generally higher. Estimate $10/site/mo -> $7,200.

### 6.3 The Cost to Use Standard/Free (Option B - Contracts)

- Common Paper: Free for standard contracts (Standard Cloud Service Agreement).
- YC SAFE: Free.
- Cost: $0.

### 6.4 Economic Verdict

**Buying is ~10x to 15x cheaper than Building.**

- Build Cost: ~$60,000 (plus distraction).
- Buy Cost: ~$3,600 (Agency Pack).

Even if the "Build" cost is purely the solo operator's time (opportunity cost), spending 160+ hours on a non-core tool is a strategic error. That time should be spent on venture validation or customer acquisition.

| Approach | Initial Setup Cost | 3-Year Maintenance | Total 3-Year Cost | Cost Per Venture | Risk Profile |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|------------------|--------------|
| Option A (Skip) | $0 | $0 | $0 (to EHG) | ~$2k-$10k (to Venture) | Low (for EHG) |
| Option C (Build) | $21,000* | $36,000 | ~$57,000 | ~$2,850 | High (UPL/Bugs) |
| Option D (LLM) | $30,000** | $50,000 | ~$80,000 | ~$4,000 | Extreme (Hallucinations) |
| Option E (Buy) | $0 | $3,600*** | ~$3,600 | ~$180 | Low (Vendor indemnifies) |

*Assumes $16k dev + $5k legal.
**Assumes higher dev complexity for AI + prompt engineering.
***Assumes GetTerms/Iubenda bulk pricing for 20 sites.

## 7. Deep Dive: The "Buy" Candidates & Solution Selection

If EHG chooses to outsource (as recommended), which platform is best suited for a venture factory managing multiple portfolios?

### 7.1 GetTerms.io (The "MVP" Choice)

**Overview**: Focuses on simplicity. "Simple policies in minutes."

**Pros**:
- Price: Extremely competitive. "Lifetime" deals are often available; Agency packs are cheap (~$5/mo).
- Agency Program: Explicitly allows reselling and client management from one dashboard.
- Simplicity: Best for simple B2C apps or landing pages that don't need complex clause logic.

**Cons**: Less granular customization than Iubenda. May struggle with complex enterprise SaaS requirements.

**Best For**: Early-stage MVPs, bootstrapped ventures, simple apps.

### 7.2 Iubenda (The "Compliance Powerhouse")

**Overview**: A comprehensive suite owned by Team.blue, widely used in Europe.

**Pros**:
- Compliance Depth: 2000+ lawyer-crafted clauses. Handles complex scenarios (e.g., differentiating between "Facebook Custom Audience" and "Google AdSense").
- White Label: Full white-labeling capabilities (remove "Powered by Iubenda") via API or agency settings.
- Multi-Jurisdiction: Excellent handling of GDPR/CCPA/LGPD nuances.

**Cons**: UX is complex; configuration takes time. Pricing can get complex with "page view" limits for cookie banners.

**Best For**: SaaS ventures selling into the EU; data-heavy startups; marketplaces.

### 7.3 Termly (The "Design" Choice)

**Overview**: Strong focus on US compliance and UX/UI design.

**Pros**: Excellent UX, very polished cookie banner (highly visible part of the stack). Good "Agency" dashboard.

**Cons**: Can be pricier; "Agency" plan often requires contacting sales.

**Best For**: Ventures where design/aesthetics of the cookie banner matter significantly.

### 7.4 Common Paper (The "Contract" Standard)

**Overview**: Not a generator, but a Standard. Creating the "GitHub for Contracts."

**Strategy**: Use Common Paper for B2B contracts (MSAs, DPAs). Do not use a generator for these; use the standard. It signals maturity to enterprise buyers and allows them to review only the cover page variables, knowing the standard terms remain unchanged.

## 8. Strategic Recommendation

### Verdict: BUY & CURATE (Hybrid of Options B and E)

**EHG should NOT build a Legal Document Generator.**

The "Build" path is an economic trap (15x cost), a liability minefield (UPL/AI risks), and a strategic distraction. The problem is "table stakes," meaning there is no upside to doing it "better" than the market, only downside if you fail.

### Recommended Strategy: The "EHG Legal Stack"

Instead of building software, build a Process. EHG should offer a standardized "Legal Stack" to every new venture as part of its "Factory OS."

**Component 1: The Compliance Layer (Privacy/Cookies)**
- Strategy: Option E (Partner).
- Action: Sign up for an Agency Account with GetTerms (for simple/cheap) or Iubenda (for robust/EU-heavy).
- Implementation:
  - EHG absorbs the small monthly cost (~$5/venture) as a value-add.
  - Use the "White Label" feature to present the policies professionally under the venture's brand (or EHG's).
  - EHG sets up the initial config (takes 10 mins) and hands over the login to the founder.
- Why: This solves the "Dynamic" problem (Geo-IP cookies, law updates). The vendor indemnifies the service.

**Component 2: The Contract Layer (ToS/DPA/MSA)**
- Strategy: Option B (Curated Standards).
- Action: Mandate the use of Common Paper standards.
- Implementation:
  - Create a library of pre-filled Common Paper "Cover Page" templates for typical venture models (SaaS, Marketplace).
- Why: It's free, attorney-vetted, and becoming an industry standard like the YC SAFE. It dramatically speeds up B2B sales cycles because counterparties recognize the terms.

**Component 3: The Corporate Layer (Formation/Equity)**
- Strategy: Referral (Option A).
- Action: Refer to Clerky (US/DE C-Corps) or Stripe Atlas.
- Implementation: Do not touch this. The liability of messing up stock issuance or 83(b) elections is too high. Use the specialists who have automated this perfectly.

## 9. Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Vendor Selection & Setup (Week 1)

- Select Vendor: Choose GetTerms for its simplicity and cost-effectiveness for MVPs. Purchase an Agency Pack (Start with 10-20 licenses).
- Select Standards: Download the Common Paper standard agreements (Cloud Service Agreement, DPA, NDA).

### Phase 2: Internal Knowledge Base (Week 2)

Create an internal Notion/Wiki page: "Legal Launchpad".

- Section 1: Privacy & Cookies: "How to activate your EHG-provided Privacy Policy (powered by GetTerms)." Instructions on embedding the snippet.
- Section 2: Contracts: "Use these Standard Contracts." Links to Common Paper templates with EHG-recommended default variables.
- Section 3: Disclaimers: Explicit statement that EHG is not a law firm and founders are responsible for final compliance.

### Phase 3: Rollout (Week 3)

- Audit: For existing ventures, check if they have valid privacy policies. If not, migrate them to the Agency account.
- Onboarding: Add "Legal Stack Setup" to the New Venture Onboarding Checklist.

### Message to Founders (The "Skip" Narrative)

> "We don't build legal software because 'good enough' isn't good enough for legal compliance. Instead, we've partnered with industry leaders to give you 'Lawyer-Grade' compliance for free. We pay for your license; you get the protection. For contracts, we use the Common Paper standard to help you close deals faster. This lets you focus on building, while the experts handle the regulations."

## 10. Key Insight

The pivotal insight driving this recommendation is that legal documentation has bifurcated into "Static" vs. "Dynamic" assets.

- **Contracts** (ToS, MSA) are becoming **Static Standards** (like code libraries), best solved by open-source frameworks like Common Paper.
- **Compliance** (Privacy, Cookies) is becoming **Dynamic Software** (like antivirus), requiring constant real-time updates via SaaS tools like Iubenda/Termly.

Trying to solve both with a single internal "Template Generator" (Option C) or an "LLM" (Option D) is a strategic error because it addresses yesterday's problem (drafting) rather than today's problem (maintenance and standardization). EHG must subscribe to the dynamic software and curate the static standards.
