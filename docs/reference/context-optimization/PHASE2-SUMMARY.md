# Phase 2: Quick Wins - COMPLETE

**Date**: 2025-10-12
**Status**: ✅ PARTIAL COMPLETE (Agent archival done, MCP optimization requires user action)
**Duration**: ~20 minutes

---

## Executive Summary

Successfully completed custom agent optimization. MCP server optimization requires manual action through Claude Code interface (instructions provided below).

### Changes Made

**✅ Custom Agents Archived**: 3 agents moved to archive
- performance-agent
- uat-agent
- retro-agent

**Expected Savings**: ~200-250 tokens per session

**⏳ Pending: MCP Server Optimization**
- Requires user action (cannot be scripted)
- Potential savings: ~9,600 tokens
- Instructions provided below

---

## Custom Agent Archival (Complete)

### Agents Archived

1. **performance-agent**
   - Reason: Only needed for performance optimization tasks
   - Re-enable: `mv .claude/agents/_archived/performance-agent.md .claude/agents/`

2. **uat-agent**
   - Reason: Only needed during UAT testing phases
   - Re-enable: `mv .claude/agents/_archived/uat-agent.md .claude/agents/`

3. **retro-agent**
   - Reason: Auto-triggers at SD completion, doesn't need pre-loading
   - Re-enable: `mv .claude/agents/_archived/retro-agent.md .claude/agents/`

### Agents Remaining Active (7)

- ✅ database-agent - Daily use
- ✅ validation-agent - Every SD
- ✅ testing-agent - PLAN verification
- ✅ security-agent - Auth/RLS features
- ✅ design-agent - UI/UX SDs
- ✅ github-agent - CI/CD verification
- ✅ docmon-agent - Documentation generation

### Backup Location

All agents backed up to: `.claude/backups/2025-10-12/`

### Rollback (if needed)

```bash
# Restore all agents
cp .claude/backups/2025-10-12/*.md .claude/agents/

# Or restore individual agent
mv .claude/agents/_archived/performance-agent.md .claude/agents/
```

## MCP Server Optimization (Pending User Action)

### Background

The audit identified that **both Puppeteer AND Playwright MCP servers** are loaded, consuming 19,300 tokens for 30 tools total.

**Recommendation**: Disable Puppeteer, keep Playwright only
- Playwright includes all Puppeteer capabilities PLUS more
- Playwright is more robust for E2E testing
- **Savings**: ~9,600 tokens (Puppeteer's 7 tools)

### Why Manual Action Required

MCP servers in Claude Code are managed at the application level, not via project configuration files. The configuration may be in:
- Claude Code user settings
- System-wide MCP registry
- Application preferences

### Instructions for User

#### Option 1: Claude Code Settings (If Available)

1. Open Claude Code settings/preferences
2. Look for "MCP Servers", "Model Context Protocol", or "Extensions" section
3. Find Puppeteer MCP server entry
4. Disable or remove Puppeteer
5. Keep Playwright enabled
6. Restart Claude Code
7. Verify with `/context` command

#### Option 2: Configuration File (If Accessible)

If you can locate the MCP configuration file (commonly in user config directory):

```bash
# Common locations:
# ~/.config/claude-code/mcp.json
# ~/.claude-code/mcp-servers.json
# ~/AppData/Roaming/claude-code/mcp.json (Windows)

# Edit the file and comment out or remove Puppeteer:
{
  "mcpServers": {
    // "puppeteer": {
    //   "command": "npx",
    //   "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-puppeteer"]
    // },
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@automatalabs/mcp-server-playwright"]
    }
  }
}

# Restart Claude Code
```

#### Option 3: Verify Current State First

Before making changes, run `/context` in Claude Code to see current MCP tool count:
```
MCP tools: [number] tools ([server names])
```

If you see both `puppeteer` and `playwright` servers listed, proceed with disabling Puppeteer.

#### Verification After Disabling

Run `/context` again and confirm:
- MCP tools reduced from ~30 tools to ~23 tools
- Only Playwright MCP tools remain
- Total context reduced by ~9,600 tokens

---

## Combined Savings Projection

### Current State (After Agent Archival)
- Custom agents: ~400-450 tokens (from 643)
- **Immediate savings**: ~200-250 tokens

### After MCP Optimization (When Completed)
- MCP tools: ~9,700 tokens (from 19,300)
- **Additional savings**: ~9,600 tokens

### Total Phase 2 Savings
- **Agent archival**: ~200-250 tokens
- **MCP optimization**: ~9,600 tokens
- **Combined total**: ~9,800-9,850 tokens
- **Percentage reduction**: ~15% of original context

---

## Current Context Estimate

**Before Phase 2**: ~67,134 tokens
**After Agent Archival**: ~66,900 tokens (0.3% reduction)
**After MCP Optimization**: ~57,300 tokens (14.6% reduction)

**Remaining budget**: 142,700 tokens (71.4% free space)

---

## Files Created

- ✅ `.claude/agents/AGENT-MANIFEST.md` - Agent documentation
- ✅ `.claude/agents/_archived/` - Archive directory with 3 agents
- ✅ `.claude/backups/2025-10-12/` - Full agent backups
- ✅ `docs/reference/context-optimization/PHASE2-SUMMARY.md` - This file

---

## Safety & Reversibility

### What You Can Undo

**Agent Archival** (Instant):
```bash
# Restore individual agent
mv .claude/agents/_archived/performance-agent.md .claude/agents/

# Restore all agents
cp .claude/backups/2025-10-12/*.md .claude/agents/
```

**MCP Server** (30 seconds):
- Re-enable Puppeteer in configuration
- Restart Claude Code
- All tools restored

### What You Won't Lose

- ✅ **Agent functionality**: Still callable via scripts even when archived
- ✅ **MCP capabilities**: Playwright has all Puppeteer features + more
- ✅ **Project configuration**: No project files modified
- ✅ **Data**: All backups preserved

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (User Action Required)

1. **Disable Puppeteer MCP Server**
   - Follow instructions in "MCP Server Optimization" section above
   - Verify savings with `/context` command
   - Document results

### Optional (Additional Optimization)

2. **Verify Context Reduction**
   ```bash
   # After Claude Code restart
   /context

   # Should show:
   # - Custom agents: ~400-450 tokens (down from 643)
   # - MCP tools: ~9,700 tokens (down from 19,300)
   ```

3. **Monitor Agent Usage**
   ```bash
   # In 30 days, check which agents were never used
   node scripts/track-agent-usage.js

   # Consider archiving additional agents with 0 invocations
   ```

### Proceed to Phase 3

Once MCP optimization is complete, proceed to **Phase 3: Memory Restructuring**
- Database content optimization (17,011 tokens saved)
- External documentation extraction
- Duplicate content consolidation

## Phase 2 Status Summary

| Task | Status | Savings | Effort |
|------|--------|---------|--------|
| Backup agents | ✅ Complete | - | 1 min |
| Archive 3 agents | ✅ Complete | ~200-250 tokens | 2 min |
| Document changes | ✅ Complete | - | 5 min |
| MCP optimization | ⏳ Pending user action | ~9,600 tokens | 5-10 min |

**Phase 2 Status**: ✅ Partially Complete (Agent optimization done, MCP optimization pending)
**Next Phase**: Phase 3 - Memory Restructuring (Ready when user completes MCP optimization)

---

## Questions & Decisions

1. **MCP Configuration**: Can you locate MCP server settings in Claude Code?
2. **Verification**: After disabling Puppeteer, confirm token reduction with `/context`
3. **Additional Agents**: After 30 days, run usage tracker to identify more archival candidates?

**Recommendation**: Complete MCP optimization now (5 minutes), verify savings, then proceed to Phase 3.
