## Genesis Oath v3.1 (February 2026)

The Genesis Oath is EHG's autonomous venture creation ceremony — the moment when raw ideas become living ventures in the platform.

### Documents (All at Version 3.1)

### Key Concepts

**The Simulation Chamber:** Generate complete venture artifacts as "possible futures" while preserving validation discipline.

**The Collapse of the Wave Function:** The ritual where a venture seed becomes a simulation, and the Sovereign commits to earning reality through the 25-stage workflow.

**The Contract of Pain:** The `/ratify` command is not permission — it's acceptance of the 25-stage labor required to transform simulation into reality.
