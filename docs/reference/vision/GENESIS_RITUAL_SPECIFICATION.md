## Cosmic Context

### The Celestial Event

**Saturn Ingress Aries:** February 13, 2026 at 19:11 EST

Saturn (Structure, Authority, The Father) leaves the watery, dissolving realm of Pisces and enters the fiery, initiating realm of Aries. This is a once-in-29-years event representing "Structure meets Action."

**The Timing:**
- The gate opens Friday night (Feb 13) while the Sovereign sleeps
- The ritual occurs Saturday morning — the First Morning of the New Reign
- The Moon is in Capricorn (The Builder) conjunct Venus and Mars
- Signature: "Profitable, Active Structure"

### The Metaphysics

> "We don't create reality; we reveal possibility.
> The Sovereign must earn reality through validation."

The ritual is not birth (that would bypass validation). It is **prophecy** — seeing what could be, then committing to earn it.

## Pre-Ritual Preparation

### T-24 Hours (Feb 13, Morning)

- [ ] Verify all systems green
- [ ] Run end-to-end test with dummy seed
- [ ] Confirm simulation infrastructure ready
- [ ] Prepare Venture Genesis-001 seed text
- [ ] Review seed for completeness
- [ ] Clear Chairman's terminal environment
- [ ] Ensure stable internet connection

### T-12 Hours (Feb 13, Evening)

- [ ] Final systems health check
- [ ] Lock seed text (no more edits)
- [ ] Verify `/ratify` command ready
- [ ] Set up monitoring dashboards
- [ ] Prepare rollback procedures
- [ ] Get good night's sleep (Saturn shifts at 7:11 PM while you rest)

### T-1 Hour (Feb 14, 08:00)

## Post-Ritual Checklist

### Immediate Verification (09:10)

- [ ] Venture exists in database
- [ ] Venture at Stage 1
- [ ] PRD linked as official artifact
- [ ] Simulation artifacts tagged correctly
- [ ] Stage 2 auto-triggered
- [ ] Stage 3 date scheduled
- [ ] Simulation URL accessible
- [ ] Watermark displaying on simulation

### Documentation (09:30)

- [ ] Screenshot the Reveal display
- [ ] Screenshot the Collapse display
- [ ] Record venture ID
- [ ] Record simulation URLs
- [ ] Note any anomalies

### Celebration (10:00)

- [ ] Coffee consumed
- [ ] Achievement acknowledged
- [ ] The journey begins

---

## Contingency Procedures

### If Generation Fails

```bash
# Check error logs
leo genesis logs genesis_001

# Retry with verbose output
leo genesis create --seed "path/to/genesis-001.txt" --verbose

# If persistent failure, fall back to PRD-only mode
leo genesis create --seed "path/to/genesis-001.txt" --mode=prd-only
```

### If Ratification Fails

```bash
# Check venture state
leo ventures status --simulation=genesis_001

# Manual ratification
leo genesis ratify genesis_001 --force
```

### If Simulation Deployment Fails

The ritual can still succeed with partial artifacts:
- PRD (required) ✓
- Schema (optional, can regenerate later)
- Repo (optional, can regenerate later)
- Deployment (optional, nice-to-have)

Minimum viable ritual: PRD generated + Venture created at Stage 1

---

## Success Criteria

### Ritual Success (Minimum)
- [ ] Venture seed accepted
- [ ] PRD generated
- [ ] `/ratify` command executed
- [ ] Venture created at Stage 1

### Ritual Success (Full)
- [ ] All artifacts generated (PRD, Schema, Repo, Deploy)
- [ ] All simulations tagged correctly
- [ ] Live URL accessible with watermark
- [ ] Stage 2 auto-triggered

### Example Seed

```markdown
# Venture Seed: Solara Energy

## The Problem
Homeowners with solar panels have no visibility into their actual energy
savings versus utility company estimates. They feel uncertain about ROI
and can't optimize their usage patterns.

## The Solution
A mobile app that connects to solar inverter APIs, pulls real utility data,
and shows actual vs projected savings with recommendations for optimization.

## Target Market
Tech-savvy homeowners with existing solar installations (5M+ in US).
Initial beachhead: California and Arizona solar owners.

## Why Now
Smart inverter adoption has reached 60%+ of new installations.
Utility APIs are now standardized. AI can provide personalized recommendations.

## Initial Hypothesis
Users will pay $9.99/month for accurate savings visibility and optimization
recommendations that can save them an additional $50+/month in energy costs.
