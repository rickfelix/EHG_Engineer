# Deep Research Prompt: Voice API Strategy for EVA Assistant

## Project Context & Background

**Current Platform:** EHG Ventures Portfolio Management Platform
- Built with React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Supabase backend
- Multiple AI agents: EVA (assistant), LEAD (lead generation), PLAN (planning), EXEC (execution), AI_CEO
- Database contains: ventures, ideas, companies, forecasts, feedback, performance metrics
- Current voice integrations: ElevenLabs Real-Time Voice API, OpenAI Real-Time Voice API

**EVA Assistant Current Capabilities:**
