# LEO Protocol Retrospective: SD-002 Shimmer Effect Implementation

**Date**: 2025-08-30
**Strategic Directive**: SD-002 - Add Shimmer Effect to AI Avatar Button
**Participants**: User, Claude Code (acting as LEAD, PLAN, EXEC agents)
**Outcome**: Eventually successful, but with significant protocol deviations

---

## Executive Summary

The implementation of SD-002 revealed critical gaps in the LEO Protocol workflow, particularly around CI/CD integration, error handling, and the handoff process between agents. While the feature was ultimately delivered successfully, the journey exposed areas where the protocol needs strengthening.

---

## Timeline of Events

### Phase 1: Initial LEO Protocol Execution
1. **LEAD Agent**: Created SD-002 with requirements
2. **PLAN Agent**: Created PRD with technical specifications  
3. **EXEC Agent**: Implemented shimmer effect in FloatingEVAAssistant.tsx
4. **Initial Push**: Committed and pushed to GitHub

### Phase 2: Discovery of Issues
1. **User Feedback**: "I think in the process of pushing, you need to check the CI/CD pipeline comments"
2. **CI/CD Check**: Pipeline failing with 1,582 linting errors
3. **Root Cause**: Pre-existing technical debt, not our changes

### Phase 3: Extended Remediation (Not in Protocol)
1. **Massive Cleanup**: 93% reduction in linting errors (1,580 → 117)
2. **Multiple Iterations**: Several rounds of fixes and pushes
3. **Tool Limitations**: Playwright installation issues
4. **Final Enhancement**: Making shimmer more visible per user feedback

## Protocol Violations & Gaps Identified

### 1. **Missing CI/CD Verification Step**
**Issue**: EXEC agent pushed code without checking pipeline status
**Impact**: User had to remind us to check CI/CD
**Gap**: Protocol didn't mandate pipeline verification

### 2. **No Pre-Implementation Health Check**
**Issue**: Started implementation without checking existing codebase health
**Impact**: Inherited 1,582 pre-existing linting errors
**Gap**: No "pre-flight check" requirement in protocol

### 3. **Incomplete Handoff Process**
**Issue**: EXEC declared completion without verification
**Impact**: Feature wasn't actually complete (pipeline failing)
**Gap**: No definition of "done" that includes CI/CD success

### 4. **No Escalation Path for Blocked Work**
**Issue**: When CI/CD failed due to pre-existing issues
**Impact**: Had to fix unrelated problems to complete task
**Gap**: No protocol for handling external blockers

### 5. **Limited Evidence Requirements**
**Issue**: No visual verification of UI changes
**Impact**: User couldn't see if shimmer was working
**Gap**: Missing visual testing requirements

### 6. **No Feedback Loop Integration**
**Issue**: User feedback about shimmer visibility came after "completion"
**Impact**: Required additional work post-handoff
**Gap**: No user acceptance criteria in protocol

## What Went Well

1. **Adaptive Problem Solving**: Successfully pivoted to fix technical debt
2. **Comprehensive Documentation**: Created SD, PRD, and implementation docs
3. **Feature Delivery**: Shimmer effect was ultimately implemented successfully
4. **Process Improvement**: Added CI/CD checks to protocol during execution

## What Could Be Improved

### 1. **Pre-Implementation Checklist**
```markdown
EXEC Pre-Flight Checklist:
- [ ] Run linting locally
- [ ] Check current CI/CD status
- [ ] Verify test suite passes
- [ ] Check for related technical debt
- [ ] Assess environment health
```

### 2. **Definition of Done**
```markdown
Implementation is complete when:
- [ ] Code is implemented per PRD
- [ ] All tests pass locally
- [ ] Linting passes with zero errors
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline is green
- [ ] Visual verification completed (for UI)
- [ ] Performance metrics acceptable
- [ ] User acceptance criteria met
```

### 3. **Blocker Escalation Protocol**
```markdown
When blocked by external factors:
1. Document the blocker type
2. Assess if it's task-critical
3. Options:
   a. Fix the blocker (if scope-appropriate)
   b. Work around the blocker
   c. Escalate to LEAD for re-scoping
   d. Create technical debt ticket
```

### 4. **Visual Verification Requirement**
```markdown
For UI/UX changes:
1. Capture before state
2. Implement change
3. Capture after state
4. Create comparison evidence
5. Run automated visual tests
6. Generate evidence report
```

## Lessons Learned

### 1. **Technical Debt is a Hidden Blocker**
- Pre-existing issues can block new feature delivery
- Need to assess codebase health before starting work
- Consider technical debt in effort estimation

### 2. **CI/CD is Part of the Definition of Done**
- A feature isn't complete if the pipeline is red
- Pipeline status should be checked at multiple points
- Pre-existing failures should be documented upfront

### 3. **User Feedback is Critical**
- "Looks good in code" ≠ "Works for users"
- Visual changes need visual verification
- User acceptance should be part of the protocol

### 4. **Protocol Flexibility vs. Rigidity**
- Protocol was too rigid about handoffs
- Needed flexibility to handle unexpected issues
- Should have provisions for iterative improvement

## Recommended Protocol Updates

### 1. **Add Stage 0: Environment Assessment**
Before LEAD creates SD, assess:
- Current CI/CD status
- Technical debt level
- Test coverage
- Known blockers

### 2. **Enhance EXEC Workflow**
```markdown
1. Pre-flight checks (NEW)
2. Implementation
3. Local verification
4. CI/CD verification (ENHANCED)
5. Visual verification (NEW)
6. User acceptance check (NEW)
7. Handoff to PLAN
```

### 3. **Add Feedback Loops**
- After each agent handoff
- After CI/CD runs
- After user review
- Allow for iterations without "failing"

### 4. **Create Technical Debt Registry**
Track and manage:
- Pre-existing issues found
- Workarounds implemented
- Future cleanup needed
- Impact on velocity

### 5. **Implement Quality Gates**
Mandatory checkpoints:
- Pre-implementation health check
- Post-implementation verification
- CI/CD success requirement
- User acceptance for UI changes

1. **Immediate**:
   - [ ] Update LEO Protocol with CI/CD verification (DONE)
   - [ ] Add visual verification requirements (DONE)
   - [ ] Document pre-existing technical debt

2. **Short-term**:
   - [ ] Create automated pre-flight check script
   - [ ] Implement quality gates in workflow
   - [ ] Add blocker escalation process

3. **Long-term**:
   - [ ] Integrate automated testing into protocol
   - [ ] Create technical debt management system
   - [ ] Develop feedback loop automation

## Conclusion

While SD-002 was ultimately successful, the implementation revealed that the LEO Protocol needs to evolve from a linear handoff model to a more iterative, feedback-driven process. The protocol should acknowledge that real-world development includes technical debt, CI/CD requirements, and user feedback loops.

The key insight: **The protocol should guide the journey, not just define the destination.**
