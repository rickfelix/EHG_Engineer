## 4. Key Decisions & Rationale

**KEY DECISIONS MADE**

1. **Decision**: Use WebRTC with data channel for events
   - **Rationale**: Lowest latency (320ms) and native ephemeral token support
   - **Impact**: More complex than WebSocket but 60% better performance

2. **Decision**: 200ms audio buffer size
   - **Rationale**: Optimal balance between quality and latency
   - **Impact**: Smooth playback without noticeable delay

3. **Decision**: Summarize at 20,000 tokens
   - **Rationale**: Prevents context overflow while maintaining conversation flow
   - **Impact**: Requires async summarization implementation

4. **Decision**: Mandatory sub-agent activation
   - **Rationale**: Security and performance requirements are critical
   - **Impact**: EXEC must coordinate with 4 sub-agents

## 5. Known Issues & Risks

**KNOWN ISSUES**

Critical: 0

Warnings: 3
- **Warning**: Deno WebSocket headers limitation
  - **Workaround**: Deploy with --no-verify-jwt flag
- **Warning**: 30-minute session limit
  - **Mitigation**: Implement handoff mechanism
- **Warning**: Potential cost overrun
  - **Mitigation**: Aggressive VAD and context management

**RISKS FORWARD**
- **Risk**: WebRTC connection complexity
  - **Probability**: Medium
  - **Impact**: High
  - **Mitigation**: Start with simple peer testing

- **Risk**: Function timeout issues
  - **Probability**: Low
  - **Impact**: Medium
  - **Mitigation**: 30s timeout with retry logic

## 6. Resource Utilization

**RESOURCE USAGE**
- Context Tokens Used: 76,000 (38% of 200,000 limit)
- Compute Time: 60 minutes
- External Services: OpenAI API, Supabase
- Dependencies Added: None (using native WebRTC)

## 7. Handoff Requirements

**ACTION REQUIRED BY EXEC AGENT**

Immediate (Day 1):
1. Implement EES-001: Infrastructure Setup (3 hours)
2. Start EES-002: WebRTC Client Implementation (3 hours)

Review Required:
1. Ephemeral token generation logic
2. WebRTC connection establishment
3. Function execution framework
4. Security implementation

Decisions Needed:
1. Error retry strategy (exponential backoff parameters)
2. Logging verbosity level
3. Feature flag approach for rollout
4. Monitoring dashboard priority

## TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE

### Critical Path (Must Complete First)
1. **EES-001**: Infrastructure - Without this, nothing works
2. **EES-002**: WebRTC Client - Core functionality
3. **EES-003**: Function Calling - Business value

### Sub-Agent Coordination

**Security Sub-Agent** (Activate for EES-001, EES-005):
- Focus: Token security, injection defense
- Deliverables: Security tests, hardened prompts
- Success Criteria: All 50 injection tests blocked

**Performance Sub-Agent** (Activate for EES-002, EES-004):
- Focus: Latency optimization, cost management
- Deliverables: Benchmarks, optimization strategies
- Success Criteria: <500ms P95, <$0.50/min

**Testing Sub-Agent** (Activate for EES-007):
- Focus: Test coverage, E2E scenarios
- Deliverables: Test suite, coverage report
- Success Criteria: >80% coverage

**Database Sub-Agent** (Activate for EES-001):
- Focus: Schema optimization, queries
- Deliverables: Migration scripts, indexes
- Success Criteria: <50ms query time

### Implementation Priorities

**Day 1 Focus**:
```typescript
// EES-001: Token Generation
async function generateEphemeralToken(userJWT: string) {
  // Validate JWT
  // Call OpenAI API
  // Return token with expiry
}

// EES-002: WebRTC Setup
class EVAVoiceAssistant {
  async connect() {
    // Get token
    // Create RTCPeerConnection
    // Establish connection
  }
}
```

**Day 2 Focus**:
- Complete WebRTC implementation
- Function calling framework
- Context management

**Day 3 Focus**:
- Security hardening
- Legacy removal
- Testing

### Acceptance Testing

For each EES item, verify:
1. Functional requirements met
2. Performance targets achieved
3. Security measures in place
4. Tests passing
5. Documentation complete

### Code Standards

Follow these patterns:
```typescript
// Use TypeScript strict mode
// Implement error boundaries
// Add comprehensive logging
// Include performance metrics
// Write self-documenting code
```

## EXEC AGENT SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS

### Your Implementation Approach

1. **Start with Infrastructure** (EES-001)
   - This unblocks everything else
   - Activate Security and Database sub-agents immediately
   - Focus on getting token generation working

2. **Build Core Functionality** (EES-002, EES-003)
   - WebRTC is complex - allocate enough time
   - Test with simple audio first
   - Add function calling once audio works

3. **Optimize and Secure** (EES-004, EES-005)
   - These can partially overlap
   - Cost management is critical
   - Security cannot be compromised

4. **Clean and Test** (EES-006, EES-007)
   - Remove legacy code completely
   - Achieve >80% test coverage
   - Validate all requirements

### Success Criteria

Your implementation is complete when:
- [ ] All 7 EES items implemented
- [ ] Sub-agents have delivered their components
- [ ] Tests passing with >80% coverage
- [ ] Performance targets met (<500ms, <$0.50/min)
- [ ] Security validation complete
- [ ] Ready for PLAN verification

### Resource Allocation

You have 18 hours total:
- Infrastructure: 3 hours
- Client Implementation: 4 hours
- Function Integration: 3 hours
- Context Management: 2 hours
- Security: 2 hours
- Cleanup: 1 hour
- Testing: 3 hours
