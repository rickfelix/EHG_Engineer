# EHG_Engineer - LEO Protocol Builder Tool

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL DISTINCTION - READ THIS FIRST!

### Two Separate Systems:

| System | Database ID | Purpose |
|--------|------------|---------|
| **EHG_Engineer** | dedlbzhpgkmetvhbkyzq | The LEO Protocol tool you're using RIGHT NOW to build applications |
| **EHG** | liapbndqlqxdcgpwntbv | The actual EHG portfolio application being built |

**Remember**: 
- EHG_Engineer = The hammer üî®
- EHG = The house you're building üè†

## Overview

EHG_Engineer is a comprehensive development environment implementing LEO Protocol v3.1.5, designed to build and manage multiple applications through an AI-assisted workflow system.

## Quick Start

### Managing Projects

```bash
# See all projects
node scripts/leo.js projects

# Switch to EHG project
node scripts/leo.js switch ehg

# Check current status
node scripts/leo.js status
```

### Adding New Projects

```bash
# Simple 3-step process
node scripts/leo.js add-project

# Then:
# 1. Copy template: cp .env.project-template .env.project-registration
# 2. Edit 2 fields: PROJECT_NAME and GITHUB_REPO
# 3. Register: node scripts/leo-register-from-env.js
```

## Project Registry

All projects are managed in `applications/registry.json`:
- APP001: ehg (the actual EHG project)
- APP002: test-leo-project (test project)
- Additional projects can be added via the registration process

## Database Connections

### For EHG Project Development:
```bash
# Connect to EHG database (NOT EHG_Engineer)
supabase link --project-ref liapbndqlqxdcgpwntbv
```

### For LEO Protocol System:
```bash
# This is only if you're modifying the LEO Protocol itself
supabase link --project-ref dedlbzhpgkmetvhbkyzq
```
