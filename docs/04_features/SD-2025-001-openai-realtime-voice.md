# Strategic Directive: OpenAI Realtime Voice Consolidation

**SD-ID**: SD-2025-001  
**Status**: Active  
**Priority**: High  
**Created**: 2025-01-02  
**LEAD Agent**: Strategic Architect v4.1  
**Target Completion**: 2025-01-05  

## Executive Summary

This Strategic Directive mandates the consolidation of three fragmented voice interfaces (11Labs Realtime, EVA Voice Conversation, EVA Text+Speech) into a single, unified OpenAI Realtime Voice implementation. This consolidation will reduce operational costs by $1,500/month, improve user experience with sub-500ms latency, and enable advanced AI capabilities through native function calling.

## Business Context

### Current State Problems
- **Fragmented User Experience**: Three different voice interfaces confuse users
- **High Operational Costs**: $1,500/month for 11Labs subscription plus OpenAI usage
- **Technical Debt**: Broken Deno WebSocket implementation blocking progress
- **Limited Intelligence**: 11Labs lacks reasoning capability, requiring separate LLM calls
- **Poor Performance**: Current setup has 800ms+ latency due to multi-hop architecture

### Strategic Opportunity
The August 2025 general availability of OpenAI's `gpt-realtime` model with 48% better instruction following and 34% better function calling accuracy provides a transformative opportunity to deliver a premium voice experience while reducing costs and complexity.

## Business Objectives

### Primary Objectives
1. **Unified Voice Experience**
   - Single interface for all voice interactions
   - Consistent behavior and capabilities
   - Seamless conversation flow

2. **Cost Optimization**
   - Eliminate $1,500/month 11Labs subscription
   - Achieve <$0.50/minute average usage cost
   - Reduce from 3 APIs to 1 API

3. **Performance Excellence**
   - <500ms voice-to-voice latency
   - Real-time conversation without delays
   - Natural, human-like interaction

4. **Advanced Capabilities**
   - Native function calling for database queries
   - Intelligent data interpretation
   - Context-aware responses
   - Second/third-order question handling

## Success Criteria

### Quantitative Metrics
- [ ] Voice response latency: <500ms (p95)
- [ ] Cost per minute: <$0.50 average
- [ ] Function call accuracy: >95%
- [ ] Uptime: 99.9% availability
- [ ] User satisfaction: >4.5/5 rating

### Qualitative Metrics
- [ ] Zero 11Labs dependencies remaining
- [ ] Single, intuitive voice interface
- [ ] Natural conversation flow
- [ ] Intelligent portfolio insights
- [ ] Proactive strategic recommendations

## Constraints & Boundaries

### Technical Constraints
- Must use existing Supabase Edge Functions infrastructure
- Cannot expose API keys to browser clients
- Must handle 30-minute session limits gracefully
- WebSocket authentication limitations in Deno runtime

### Resource Constraints
- Development time: 18 hours maximum
- Timeline: 3 days (by 2025-01-05)
- Team: Single full-stack developer
- Budget: Existing OpenAI API budget

### Operational Constraints
- No downtime during migration
- Maintain backward compatibility during transition
- Preserve existing conversation history
- Support 50 concurrent sessions

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| WebSocket auth failure | High | High | Use ephemeral token pattern with WebRTC |
| Cost overrun ($1+/min) | Medium | High | Aggressive context management, VAD, caching |
| Latency >500ms | Low | Medium | WebRTC direct connection, edge deployment |
| Session timeout issues | Medium | Medium | Implement session handoff with summarization |

### Security Risks
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Voice prompt injection | Medium | High | Input classification layer, hardened prompts |
| API key exposure | Low | Critical | Ephemeral tokens only, no client keys |
| Data leakage | Low | High | Output filtering, secure prompts |

### Business Risks
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| User adoption friction | Low | Medium | Clear migration communication, training |
| Feature parity gaps | Low | Low | Comprehensive testing before cutover |
