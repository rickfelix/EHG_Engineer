# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## SD-002: Add Shimmer Effect to AI Avatar Button

**Document Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: 2025-08-30  
**Author**: PLAN Agent - LEO Protocol  
**Strategic Directive**: SD-002  
**Status**: Ready for Implementation  

---

## 1. Executive Summary

This PRD defines the technical implementation requirements for adding a shimmer effect to the AI Avatar button, ensuring visual consistency with existing Quick Action buttons in the EHG application.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

The AI Avatar button currently lacks the visual feedback and polish present in other interactive elements, specifically the Quick Action buttons which feature a subtle shimmer animation. This inconsistency creates a disjointed user experience.

---

## 3. Solution Overview

Implement the existing shimmer animation pattern on the AI Avatar button using the established Tailwind CSS animation classes and patterns already present in the codebase.

---

## 4. Technical Specification

### 4.1 Component Identification

**Primary Search Targets:**
1. Components with "Avatar" in filename or content
2. Voice-related components (voice assistant likely uses avatar)
3. Navigation header components
4. Toolbar components

**Search Commands:**
```bash
grep -r "Avatar.*button\|avatar.*circle" --include="*.tsx"
grep -r "voice.*avatar\|ai.*avatar" --include="*.tsx"
```

### 4.2 Implementation Pattern

Based on analysis of `ModernNavigationSidebar.tsx`, apply the following pattern:

```tsx
// Before (hypothetical current state)
<button className="rounded-full p-2 bg-primary">
  <AvatarIcon />
</button>

// After (with shimmer effect)
<button 
  className={cn(
    "rounded-full p-2 bg-primary",
    "relative overflow-hidden",
    "before:absolute before:inset-0",
    "before:bg-gradient-to-r",
    "before:from-cyan-500/0 before:via-cyan-500/8 before:to-cyan-500/0",
    "before:animate-[shimmer_4s_ease-in-out_infinite]",
    "dark:before:from-cyan-400/0 dark:before:via-cyan-400/10 dark:before:to-cyan-400/0"
  )}
>
  <AvatarIcon className="relative z-10" />
</button>
```

### 4.3 Technical Details

**Animation Properties:**
- Animation: `shimmer` (already defined in `tailwind.config.ts`)
- Duration: 4s (matching voice assistant timing)
- Easing: ease-in-out
- Iteration: infinite

**Color Scheme:**
- Light mode: `cyan-500` at 8% opacity
- Dark mode: `cyan-400` at 10% opacity
- Gradient: from transparent → via color → to transparent

**CSS Classes Required:**
- `relative overflow-hidden` - Container setup
- `before:absolute before:inset-0` - Pseudo-element positioning
- `before:bg-gradient-to-r` - Gradient direction
- `before:animate-[shimmer_4s_ease-in-out_infinite]` - Animation application

## 5. Implementation Tasks

### Task 1: Locate AI Avatar Component
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Identify the exact file and component containing the AI Avatar button
- Document the current implementation
- Note any existing animations or effects

### Task 2: Apply Shimmer Classes
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Add required Tailwind classes to the button
- Ensure z-index layering (icon above shimmer)
- Maintain all existing functionality

### Task 3: Dark Mode Support
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Implement dark mode color variants
- Test in both light and dark themes
- Ensure proper contrast and visibility

### Task 4: Testing & Validation
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Shimmer animation runs smoothly at 60fps
- No layout shifts or reflows
- Works across all supported browsers
- Passes accessibility checks

## 6. Testing Requirements

### 6.1 Functional Testing
- [ ] Shimmer effect is visible on AI Avatar button
- [ ] Animation loops continuously
- [ ] Button remains clickable
- [ ] Original functionality preserved

### 6.2 Visual Testing
- [ ] Shimmer matches Quick Action button style
- [ ] Proper opacity in light mode
- [ ] Proper opacity in dark mode
- [ ] No visual artifacts or glitches

### 6.3 Performance Testing
- [ ] Animation maintains 60fps
- [ ] No increased CPU usage
- [ ] GPU acceleration active
- [ ] No memory leaks

### 6.4 Browser Testing
- [ ] Chrome/Edge (latest)
- [ ] Firefox (latest)
- [ ] Safari (latest)

---

## 7. Success Metrics

- Visual consistency score: 100% match with Quick Action buttons
- Performance impact: <1% CPU increase
- Browser compatibility: 100% pass rate
- User feedback: Positive or neutral (no complaints about distraction)

---

## 8. Dependencies

**Existing Code:**
- `tailwind.config.ts` - Shimmer animation definition
- `ModernNavigationSidebar.tsx` - Reference implementation
- Tailwind CSS animation utilities

**No External Dependencies Required**

## 9. Risk Assessment

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Performance degradation | Low | Medium | Use GPU-accelerated properties only |
| Browser incompatibility | Low | Low | Fallback to no animation |
| User distraction | Low | Low | Keep opacity subtle (5-8%) |
| Implementation complexity | Low | Low | Reuse existing patterns |

    // Base styles
    "rounded-full p-3 bg-primary",
    // Shimmer setup
    "relative overflow-hidden",
    // Light mode shimmer
    "before:absolute before:inset-0 before:bg-gradient-to-r",
    "before:from-cyan-500/0 before:via-cyan-500/8 before:to-cyan-500/0",
    "before:animate-[shimmer_4s_ease-in-out_infinite]",

## Notes for EXEC Agent

1. Start by locating the AI Avatar component
2. Use the existing shimmer pattern from ModernNavigationSidebar.tsx as reference
3. No new CSS or animations needed - everything exists in the codebase
4. Test thoroughly before pushing to GitHub
5. Document any deviations from this PRD
