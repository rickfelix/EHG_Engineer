}
```

## 3.5. Database Schema Integration

**Canonical Schema Reference**: `enhanced_prds/stage_56_database_schema_enhanced.md`

### Core Entity Dependencies

The Timing Optimization module integrates directly with the universal database schema to ensure all timing data is properly structured and accessible across stages:

- **Venture Entity**: Core venture information for timing optimization context
- **Chairman Feedback Schema**: Executive timing preferences and strategic decision frameworks  
- **Timing Analysis Schema**: Multi-factor timing assessment and optimization data
- **Market Conditions Schema**: Real-time market intelligence and competitive timing data  
- **Resource Scheduling Schema**: Capacity constraints and resource optimization data

```typescript
interface Stage38DatabaseIntegration {
  ventureEntity: Stage56VentureSchema;
  chairmanFeedback: Stage56ChairmanFeedbackSchema;  
  timingAnalysis: Stage56TimingAnalysisSchema;
  marketConditions: Stage56MarketConditionsSchema;
  resourceScheduling: Stage56ResourceSchedulingSchema;
  auditTrail: Stage56AuditSchema;
}
```

#### Universal Contract Enforcement

- **Stage 38 Timing Optimization Data Contracts**: All timing assessments conform to Stage 56 strategic intelligence contracts
- **Cross-Stage Timing Consistency**: Timing Optimization properly coordinated with Stage 37 Strategic Risk Forecasting and Stage 39 Multi-Venture Coordination  
- **Audit Trail Compliance**: Complete timing decision documentation for strategic execution and performance optimization contexts

## 3.6. Integration Hub Connectivity  

**Integration Hub Reference**: `enhanced_prds/stage_51_integration_hub_enhanced.md`

### Integration Requirements

Timing Optimization connects to multiple external services via Integration Hub connectors:

- **Market Intelligence**: Bloomberg, Reuters, TradingView via Market Data Hub connectors
- **Competitive Analysis**: SimilarWeb, SEMrush, Ahrefs via Intelligence Hub connectors  
- **Resource Planning**: Microsoft Project, Smartsheet, Monday.com via Project Hub connectors
- **Analytics Platforms**: Google Analytics, Adobe Analytics via Analytics Hub connectors
- **Calendar Integration**: Google Calendar, Outlook, Calendly via Calendar Hub connectors

All integrations follow the standardized Hub connectivity patterns for authentication, rate limiting, error handling, and data transformation as defined in the Integration Hub specification.
