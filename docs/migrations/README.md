# Migration Documentation

This directory contains documentation about data migrations, system migrations, and architectural transitions.

## Purpose

Migration documentation captures:
- **Data migrations**: Moving data between systems or schemas
- **System migrations**: Platform or infrastructure changes
- **Architecture transitions**: Major refactoring efforts
- **Protocol upgrades**: LEO Protocol version migrations

## Difference from /database/migrations/

| Directory | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `/database/migrations/` | SQL migration files (executable code) |
| `/docs/migrations/` | Migration documentation and guides |

## File Types

### Migration Guides
```
{SYSTEM}_{TYPE}_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md
```

Step-by-step instructions for performing migrations:
- Pre-migration checklist
- Migration steps
- Validation procedures
- Rollback instructions

### Migration Summaries
```
{SYSTEM}_MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md
```

Post-migration documentation:
- What was migrated
- Issues encountered
- Lessons learned
- Remaining work

### Migration Plans
```

## Overview
[Brief description of migration]

## Pre-Migration Checklist
- [ ] Backup current system
- [ ] Test migration in staging
- [ ] Communication sent to stakeholders
- [ ] Rollback plan documented

## Migration Steps
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
...

## Validation
- [ ] Data integrity verified
- [ ] Functionality tested
- [ ] Performance acceptable
- [ ] No errors in logs

## Rollback Procedure
[How to undo migration if needed]

## Post-Migration Tasks
- [ ] Update documentation

```

## Best Practices

1. **Always test in staging first**
2. **Create backup before migration**
3. **Document rollback procedures**
4. **Validate data after migration**
5. **Monitor system after changes**
6. **Create retrospective for large migrations**
