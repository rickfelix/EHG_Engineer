# 9. Gap Analysis & Market Opportunity Modeling

- **Depends on**: 8
- **Purpose**: Identify capability gaps and model market opportunities.

## Entry Gate
- Decomposition complete
- Market analyzed

## Exit Gate
- Gaps identified
- Opportunities prioritized
- Roadmap defined

## Inputs
- Current capabilities
- Market requirements
- Competitor analysis

## Outputs
- Gap analysis report
- Opportunity matrix
- Capability roadmap

## Substages & Checklists
### 9.1 Capability Assessment
  - [ ] Current state documented
  - [ ] Required capabilities listed

### 9.2 Gap Identification
  - [ ] Gaps catalogued
  - [ ] Severity assessed
  - [ ] Priority assigned

### 9.3 Opportunity Modeling
  - [ ] Opportunities mapped
  - [ ] Market size estimated
  - [ ] ROI projected

## Progression Mode
Manual (default). System learns from Chairman feedback over time to suggest Auto.

## Metric -> Action Map (examples)
- Gap impact < ${thresholds.stage9.gap_impact_max} -> **Advance**
- Opportunity score > ${thresholds.stage9.opportunity_score_min} -> **Prioritize for development**
- Capability coverage > ${thresholds.stage9.capability_coverage_min} -> **Proceed to technical review**

## Data Flow (contract skeleton)
- **Inputs**: work_breakdown_structure.json from Stage 8, market_analysis.json
- **Outputs**: gap_analysis.json, opportunity_matrix.json -> stored in DB, consumed by Stage 10

## Rollback
- Preserve gap analysis for strategic review
- Return to Stage 8 if decomposition missed key areas
- Document capability requirements for acquisition

## Tooling & Integrations
- **Primary Tools**: Gap Analysis Agent, Market Intelligence Tools
- **APIs**: TODO: Capability assessment APIs, Market data feeds
- **External Services**: TODO: Competitive intelligence platforms

## Error Handling
- Incomplete capability data -> Use industry benchmarks
- Market data unavailable -> Conservative opportunity estimates
- Gap too large -> Phased capability building plan

## Metrics & KPIs
- Gap coverage
- Opportunity size
- Capability score

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Primary Risk**: Underestimating capability gaps
- **Mitigation Strategy**: External validation, competitive benchmarking
- **Fallback Plan**: Partnership or acquisition strategy

## Failure Modes & Recovery
- **Common Failures**: Missed opportunities, overestimated capabilities
- **Recovery Steps**: Market research refresh, capability audit
- **Rollback Procedure**: Return to Stage 8 for re-decomposition

## Security/Compliance Considerations
- **Data Security**: Standard EHG data protection policies apply
- **Compliance**: SOX, GDPR where applicable
- **Audit Trail**: All decisions and changes logged

## Notes / Open Questions
- TODO: Map to specific PRD implementations
- TODO: Define gap scoring methodology
- TODO: Establish opportunity valuation models
