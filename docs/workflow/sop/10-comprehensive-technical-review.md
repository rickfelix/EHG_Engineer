# 10. Comprehensive Technical Review

- **Depends on**: 9
- **Purpose**: Validate technical architecture and implementation feasibility.

## Entry Gate
- Architecture designed
- Requirements defined

## Exit Gate
- Architecture approved
- Feasibility confirmed
- Tech debt acceptable

## Inputs
- Technical requirements
- Architecture design
- Resource constraints

## Outputs
- Technical review report
- Architecture validation
- Implementation plan

## Substages & Checklists
### 10.1 Architecture Review
  - [ ] Design validated
  - [ ] Patterns approved
  - [ ] Standards met

### 10.2 Scalability Assessment
  - [ ] Load projections validated
  - [ ] Scaling strategy defined

### 10.3 Security Review
  - [ ] Security assessment complete
  - [ ] Compliance verified
  - [ ] Risks mitigated

### 10.4 Implementation Planning
  - [ ] Development approach set
  - [ ] Timeline validated
  - [ ] Resources confirmed

## Progression Mode
Manual (default). System learns from Chairman feedback over time to suggest Auto.

## Metric -> Action Map (examples)
- Tech feasibility > ${thresholds.stage10.tech_feasibility_min} -> **Advance**
- Integration risk > ${thresholds.stage10.integration_risk_max} -> **Re-architect**
- Architecture score > ${thresholds.stage10.architecture_score_min} -> **Approve for development**
- Security readiness > ${thresholds.stage10.security_readiness_min} -> **Clear for implementation**

## Data Flow (contract skeleton)
- **Inputs**: gap_analysis.json, opportunity_matrix.json from Stage 9
- **Outputs**: technical_review.json, architecture_validation.json -> stored in DB, consumed by Stage 11

## Rollback
- Preserve technical assessments for iteration
- Return to Stage 9 if gaps invalidate architecture
- Document technical debt for future resolution

## Tooling & Integrations
- **Primary Tools**: Architecture Review Agent, Security Scanner
- **APIs**: TODO: Code quality APIs, Security assessment services
- **External Services**: TODO: Architecture validation tools

## Error Handling
- Architecture flaws detected -> Redesign critical components
- Security vulnerabilities found -> Immediate remediation plan
- Scalability issues -> Alternative architecture patterns

## Metrics & KPIs
- Technical debt score
- Scalability rating
- Security score

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Primary Risk**: Technical debt accumulation
- **Mitigation Strategy**: Regular architecture reviews, refactoring sprints
- **Fallback Plan**: Modular architecture for isolated replacements

## Failure Modes & Recovery
- **Common Failures**: Overlooked integration points, security gaps
- **Recovery Steps**: Comprehensive testing, external security audit
- **Rollback Procedure**: Return to Stage 9 for capability reassessment

## Security/Compliance Considerations
- **Data Security**: Standard EHG data protection policies apply
- **Compliance**: SOX, GDPR where applicable
- **Audit Trail**: All decisions and changes logged

## Notes / Open Questions
- TODO: Map to specific PRD implementations
- TODO: Define architecture patterns library
- TODO: Establish security baseline requirements
