## Regeneration Note

**This is the SECOND generation of this dossier** (Phase 5 contract).

**Changes from Phase 4**:
- Added TECH-001 trigger integration across files 07, 09, 10
- Expanded recursion blueprint to 200+ lines (matching Stage 5 detail level)
- Added Chairman approval workflows and UI/UX implications
- Documented technical debt/security/scalability scoring logic
- SD cross-reference notes in gaps-backlog (File 10)
- Full acceptance checklist with ≥85/100 target (aiming for 92+ as recursion hub)

## Executive Summary

**Stage ID**: 10
**Title**: Comprehensive Technical Review
**Phase**: Ideation (Stages 1-10)
**Depends On**: Stage 9 (Resource Allocation & Capacity Planning)
**Next Stage**: 11 (Strategic Naming & Brand Foundation)

Stage 10 conducts comprehensive technical validation of architecture, scalability, security, and implementation feasibility. This is a **CRITICAL technical quality gate** - blocking issues automatically trigger TECH-001 recursion to earlier stages (primarily Stage 8 for re-decomposition).

**Maturity**: ⚠️ Not Implemented (technical review automation and recursion engine incomplete)
**Automation Level**: Manual → Assisted → Auto (from stages.yaml notes)
**Critical Path**: Yes (technical approval blocks downstream execution)

**Key Metrics**: Technical debt score, Scalability rating, Security score
**Primary Exit Gates**: Architecture approved, Feasibility confirmed, Tech debt acceptable

**Recursion Support**: ✅ **DETAILED** - Triggers TECH-001 (to Stages 3, 5, 7, 8), receives TECH-001 (from Stages 14, 22)

## Quick Reference

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **ID** | 10 |
| **Dependencies** | Stage 9 |
| **Substages** | 4 (10.1 Architecture Review, 10.2 Scalability Assessment, 10.3 Security Review, 10.4 Implementation Planning) |
| **Inputs** | Technical requirements, Architecture design, Resource constraints |
| **Outputs** | Technical review report, Architecture validation, Implementation plan |
| **Overall Score** | 3.2/5.0 (from critique) |
| **Recursion Triggers** | 4 outbound, 2 inbound (TECH-001 primary) |
| **Critical Threshold** | Blocking issues ≥ 1 → Recurse to Stage 8 (HIGH severity, needs approval) |
