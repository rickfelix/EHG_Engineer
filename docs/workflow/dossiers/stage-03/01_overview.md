## Executive Summary

**Stage ID**: 3
**Title**: Comprehensive Validation
**Phase**: Ideation (Stages 1-10)
**Depends On**: Stage 2 (AI Review)
**Next Stage**: 4 (Competitive Intelligence & Market Defense)

Stage 3 validates problem-solution fit, user willingness to pay, and technical feasibility. This is a critical Kill/Revise/Proceed gate where ventures are terminated, sent back for rework, or approved for next stages.

**Maturity**: ✅ Implemented (Validation framework active)
**Automation Level**: Manual → Assisted (from stages.yaml notes)
**Critical Path**: Yes (decision gate blocks all downstream stages)

**Key Metrics**: Validation score, User interest level, Technical feasibility score
**Primary Exit Gates**: Problem validated, Solution validated, Kill/Revise/Proceed decision

**Recursion Support**: ✅ **DETAILED** - Receives FIN-001 (from Stage 5), MKT-001 (from Stage 6+), QUALITY-001 (from Stage 10+)
