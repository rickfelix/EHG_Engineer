## Upstream Dependencies

### Stage 10: Comprehensive Technical Review

**What Stage 11 Receives**:
- Technical requirements (inputs for brand positioning)
- Architecture design (technical product identity)
- Implementation plan (technical capabilities inform brand promise)

**Why This Matters**:
- Brand identity must align with technical capabilities (e.g., can't promise "real-time" if tech is batch-processing)
- Product naming conventions must fit technical architecture (microservices need consistent service naming)
- Legal requirements may emerge from technical review (open-source licensing affects brand)

**Entry Gates**:
- ✅ Positioning defined (from market positioning input)
- ✅ Market validated (from brand strategy input)

**Evidence**:
- EHG_Engineer@6ef8cf4:docs/workflow/stages.yaml:466-469 "inputs: Market positioning, Brand strategy"
- EHG_Engineer@6ef8cf4:docs/workflow/stages.yaml:479-481 "entry gates"

## Downstream Impact

### Stage 12: Adaptive Naming Module

**What Stage 12 Receives**:
- Brand name (for adaptation across markets)
- Brand guidelines (constraints for naming variations)
- Trademark search (legal boundaries for adaptations)

**Why This Matters**:
- Adaptive naming must respect brand guidelines from Stage 11
- Trademark clearance establishes legal boundaries for variations
- Brand strength score sets baseline for adaptation effectiveness

**Exit Gates**:
- ✅ Name selected (primary brand identity established)
- ✅ Trademark cleared (legal protection secured)
- ✅ Brand guidelines set (consistency framework created)

**Evidence**:
- EHG_Engineer@6ef8cf4:docs/workflow/critique/stage-12.md:58 "Upstream Dependencies: 11"
- EHG_Engineer@6ef8cf4:docs/workflow/stages.yaml:482-485 "exit gates"

## Workflow Position Context

**Ideation → Execution Bridge**:

Stage 11 is the LAST branding/marketing-focused stage in Ideation. After Stage 11, the workflow shifts to execution-oriented activities (adaptive naming, development preparation, testing).

**Key Transition**:
- **Before Stage 11**: Market analysis, technical validation, resource planning
- **Stage 11**: Crystallize brand identity and naming conventions
- **After Stage 11**: Adapt brand for execution contexts, build product

**Evidence**: EHG_Engineer@6ef8cf4:docs/workflow/stages.yaml:461-505 "Stage 11 context in full workflow"

---

## Parallel Workflow Consideration

**No Parallelization**: Stage 11 is sequential (requires Stage 10 completion)

**Rationale**:
- Brand naming must align with validated technical capabilities
- Trademark search requires finalized product positioning
- Brand guidelines depend on complete market understanding

**Evidence**: EHG_Engineer@6ef8cf4:docs/workflow/stages.yaml:464-465 "depends_on: [10]" (single dependency, no parallel paths)

---

## Critical Path Analysis

**Stage 11 is NOT on critical path** (per critique line 60).

**Implications**:
- Brand work can proceed with more flexibility (less time pressure)
- Quality/thoroughness prioritized over speed
- Delays in Stage 11 do not block technical development (Stages 14+)

**Trade-offs**:
- Lower priority for resource allocation vs critical path stages
- May be deprioritized if resource constraints emerge
- Could become bottleneck if trademark search reveals conflicts

**Evidence**: EHG_Engineer@6ef8cf4:docs/workflow/critique/stage-11.md:60 "Critical Path: No"
