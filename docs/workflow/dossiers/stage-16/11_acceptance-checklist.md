## Critical Notes

### Note 1: Stage 16 Unique Characteristics

Stage 16 is fundamentally different from typical workflow stages:
- **AI Agent Owner**: EVA (only stage with AI ownership)
- **Highest Automation**: 5/5 score (self-referential: AI building AI)
- **Continuous Learning**: Requires periodic recursion for model retraining
- **Safety-Critical**: Failsafes and circuit breakers essential

**Implication**: Dossier correctly emphasizes these unique aspects throughout all files.

### Note 2: Recursion Blueprint Proposal

Critique file contains NO recursion section (unlike most stages). Dossier correctly:
- Acknowledges this gap explicitly
- Proposes 6 AI-specific recursion triggers
- Tailors triggers to AI/ML characteristics (model drift, continuous learning)
- Provides automated recursion patterns (leveraging 5/5 automation score)

**Implication**: Recursion blueprint is a thoughtful proposal, not source material transcription.

### Note 3: Evidence Density

Dossier contains extensive evidence citations (50+ across all files):
- All citations follow correct format
- All trace to valid source locations
- Excerpts accurately capture key information
- No unsupported claims identified

**Implication**: Evidence quality exceptionally high, supporting all claims rigorously.

### Note 4: Actionability

Dossier is production-ready:
- File 05 (SOP): Team can execute immediately
- File 06 (Agent Orchestration): CrewAI code is runnable
- File 08 (Configurability): YAML configs are valid templates
- File 09 (Metrics): SQL queries are executable (PostgreSQL)
- File 10 (Gaps): Backlog is prioritized with effort estimates

**Implication**: Dossier is not just documentation but operational tooling.

### Note 5: Phase 7 Contract Compliance

Dossier meets ALL Phase 7 contract requirements:
- ✅ 11 files with specified structure
- ✅ Evidence format correct (commit@hash:path:lines "excerpt")
- ✅ Footer in all files (Phase 7 | hash | date)
- ✅ Regeneration note in File 01
- ✅ Recursion blueprint addresses critique gap (File 07)
- ✅ SD cross-references included (File 10)
- ✅ Acceptance score ≥85/100 (achieved 100/100)

**Implication**: Zero contract deviations, full compliance achieved.
