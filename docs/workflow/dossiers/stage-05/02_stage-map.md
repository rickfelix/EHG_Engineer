## Upstream Dependencies

**Depends On**: Stage 4 (Competitive Intelligence & Market Defense)

**Inputs Required**:
- Market size data (from Stage 4 market analysis)
- Pricing strategy (from Stage 4 positioning)
- Cost estimates (from Stage 3 feasibility assessment)

**Entry Gates**:
1. Market positioning defined
2. Pricing signals captured

**Cannot Proceed Without**: Competitive positioning strategy and pricing validation from Stage 4

**Evidence**: EHG_Engineer@6ef8cf4:docs/workflow/stages.yaml:188-203 "inputs: Market size data, Pricing..."

---

## Downstream Impact

**Next Stage**: Stage 6 (Risk Evaluation)

**Outputs Provided**:
- Financial model (revenue, costs, profitability over time)
- P&L projections (3-5 year forecast)
- Break-even analysis (timeline to profitability)

**Exit Gates**:
1. Financial model complete
2. Profitability validated
3. Investment requirements defined

**Blocks Downstream**: Stage 6 cannot assess risk without understanding investment requirements and financial projections

**Evidence**: EHG_Engineer@6ef8cf4:docs/workflow/stages.yaml:193-207 "outputs: Financial model, P&L..."

---

## Critical Path Position

**Status**: ✅ On Critical Path

**Reasoning**: Financial viability is a go/no-go decision. All downstream stages (Risk, Customer Discovery, Technical Feasibility) assume financial viability. Stage 5 can kill ventures that are not profitable.

**Kill Conditions**:
- ROI < 15% after 3 recursions to Stage 3
- Break-even > 60 months
- Margin forecasts persistently below 15%
- Chairman override required to proceed

**Evidence**: EHG_Engineer@6ef8cf4:docs/workflow/critique/stage-05.md:95-100 "Max recursions: 3 returns from Stage 5"

## Recursion Connections

**Outbound Recursion** (triggers FROM this stage):

| Target Stage | Trigger Type | Severity | Condition |
|--------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Stage 3 | FIN-001 | CRITICAL | ROI < 15% (auto-execute) |
| Stage 4 | FIN-001 | HIGH | Margin forecasts below target (needs approval) |
| Stage 2 | FIN-001 | CRITICAL | Revenue model fundamentally flawed (auto-execute) |

**Inbound Recursion** (triggers TO this stage):

| From Stage | Trigger Type | Severity | Condition |
|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Stage 6 | FIN-001 | HIGH | Risk assessment uncovers hidden costs |
| Stage 10 | TECH-001 | HIGH | Technical feasibility reveals higher dev costs |

## Parallel vs Sequential

**Execution Mode**: Sequential (cannot parallelize financial modeling for single venture)

**Rationale**: Revenue projections must complete before cost structure can be validated. Break-even analysis requires both revenue and cost models.

**Substage Dependencies**:
1. **5.1 Revenue Modeling** (first) → Revenue streams + growth projections
2. **5.2 Cost Structure** (second) → COGS, OpEx, CapEx using revenue model
3. **5.3 Profitability Analysis** (third) → Break-even, margins, ROI from 5.1 + 5.2

**Evidence**: EHG_Engineer@6ef8cf4:docs/workflow/stages.yaml:208-225 "substages: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3"
