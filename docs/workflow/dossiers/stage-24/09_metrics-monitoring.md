# Stage 24: Metrics Monitoring

## KPI Dashboard

### Metric 1: Iteration velocity

**Definition**: Iteration velocity measurement for Stage 24  
**Threshold**: ≥90% (target)  
**Measurement Frequency**: Per execution

**SQL Query**:
```sql
SELECT venture_id,
       iteration velocity,
       measured_at
FROM stage_24_metrics
WHERE venture_id = 'VENTURE-001'
ORDER BY measured_at DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

### Metric 2: Improvement rate

**Definition**: Improvement rate measurement for Stage 24  
**Threshold**: <500ms (target)  
**Measurement Frequency**: Per execution

**SQL Query**:
```sql
SELECT venture_id,
       improvement rate,
       measured_at
FROM stage_24_metrics
WHERE venture_id = 'VENTURE-001'
ORDER BY measured_at DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

### Metric 3: User satisfaction

**Definition**: User satisfaction measurement for Stage 24  
**Threshold**: Venture-specific  
**Measurement Frequency**: Per execution

**SQL Query**:
```sql
SELECT venture_id,
       user satisfaction,
       measured_at
FROM stage_24_metrics
WHERE venture_id = 'VENTURE-001'
ORDER BY measured_at DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

## Dashboard Visualization

**Panel 1**: Iteration velocity (gauge chart, 0-100%)  
**Panel 2**: Improvement rate (time series, ms)  
**Panel 3**: User satisfaction (bar chart)

**Alert Thresholds**:
- Iteration velocity <85%: WARNING
- Iteration velocity <75%: CRITICAL
- Improvement rate >1000ms: WARNING
- Improvement rate >2000ms: CRITICAL
