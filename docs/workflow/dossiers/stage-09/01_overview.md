## Executive Summary

**Stage ID**: 9
**Title**: Gap Analysis & Market Opportunity Modeling
**Phase**: Ideation (Stages 1-10)
**Depends On**: Stage 8 (Problem Decomposition Engine)
**Next Stage**: 10 (Comprehensive Technical Review)

Stage 9 identifies capability gaps between current state and market requirements, models market opportunities, and creates capability roadmaps. This stage bridges the gap between internal capabilities (what we can do) and market demands (what customers need), prioritizing opportunities based on strategic fit and ROI potential.

**Maturity**: ⚠️ Not Implemented (gap analysis automation and opportunity modeling incomplete)
**Automation Level**: Manual → Assisted → Auto (from stages.yaml notes)
**Critical Path**: Yes (gap identification required for realistic technical review and resource planning)

**Key Metrics**: Gap coverage, Opportunity size, Capability score
**Primary Exit Gates**: Gaps identified, Opportunities prioritized, Roadmap defined

**Recursion Support**: ⚠️ **NO RECURSION TRIGGERS DEFINED** - Gap documented in File 07

**Evidence**: EHG_Engineer@6ef8cf4:docs/workflow/stages.yaml:365-409 "id: 9, title: Gap Analysis"
