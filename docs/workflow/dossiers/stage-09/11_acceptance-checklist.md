## Total Score Calculation

| Criteria | Max Points | Awarded Points |
|----------|------------|----------------|
| 1. Evidence Completeness | 15 | 15 |
| 2. Sources Table Presence | 10 | 10 |
| 3. Footer Comment Consistency | 10 | 10 |

| 5. Regeneration Note | 5 | 5 |
| 6. SD Cross-References | 10 | 10 |
| 7. Comprehensive Coverage | 20 | 20 |
| 8. Honest Gap Handling | 15 | 15 |
| **TOTAL** | **100** | **100** |

---

## Acceptance Decision

**Status**: ✅ **PASS**

**Score**: 100/100 (Target: ≥85)

**Rationale**:
- All 11 files present with comprehensive content
- All claims properly cited with evidence format
- All files have Sources Tables and footer comments
- Recursion gaps honestly documented with scan evidence
- All gaps cross-referenced to potential SDs
- No fabricated assets or evidence
- Regeneration Note present
- Exceeds acceptance threshold by 15 points

**Critical Notes**:
1. **Recursion Gap Acknowledged**: Stage 9 has no recursion triggers defined in current critique. This is documented as Gap 6 in File 10 and proposed for SD-RECURSION-AI-002.
2. **Metric Thresholds Proposed**: Thresholds (≥80% gap coverage, ≥$2M SOM, ≥3.0 capability score) are proposed, not in stages.yaml. Marked as "proposed" in File 08 and File 09.
3. **SD References Conditional**: All SD cross-references marked "if exists" since actual SD IDs may differ from proposed names.

**Recommendation**: Dossier is production-ready. Stage 9 implementation can proceed using this dossier as specification, addressing gaps in priority order (File 10, Backlog Summary).
