## Execution Steps

### Substage 4.1: Competitor Identification

**Owner**: LEAD agent

**Steps**:
1. Load market research from Stage 3
2. Identify direct competitors (same problem, same solution approach)
3. Identify indirect competitors (same problem, different solution approach)
4. Map competitor landscape (market share, positioning)
5. Document competitor list with URLs, descriptions, funding status

**Done When**:
- Direct competitors listed
- Indirect competitors mapped

**Evidence**: EHG_Engineer@6ef8cf4:docs/workflow/stages.yaml:161-165

### Substage 4.2: Feature Comparison

**Owner**: LEAD agent

**Steps**:
1. Create feature matrix (rows: competitors, columns: features)
2. Research competitor features (websites, demos, documentation)
3. Identify feature gaps (what competitors have that we don't)
4. Identify feature advantages (what we have that competitors don't)
5. Calculate feature parity score

**Done When**:
- Feature matrix complete
- Gaps identified

**Evidence**: EHG_Engineer@6ef8cf4:docs/workflow/stages.yaml:166-170

---

### Substage 4.3: Market Positioning

**Owner**: LEAD agent

**Steps**:
1. Define unique selling proposition (USP) based on feature advantages
2. Set differentiation strategy (cost leadership, differentiation, niche focus)
3. Identify target market segment
4. Create positioning statement
5. Validate positioning against competitor landscape

**Done When**:
- USP defined
- Differentiation strategy set

**Evidence**: EHG_Engineer@6ef8cf4:docs/workflow/stages.yaml:171-175

---

### Substage 4.4: Defense Strategy

**Owner**: LEAD agent

**Steps**:
1. Define competitive moat (network effects, proprietary data, brand, etc.)
2. Outline IP strategy (patents, trademarks, trade secrets)
3. Identify barriers to entry for new competitors
4. Document defense strategy
5. Calculate moat strength score

**Done When**:
- Competitive moat defined
- IP strategy outlined

**Evidence**: EHG_Engineer@6ef8cf4:docs/workflow/stages.yaml:176-180

---

## Exit Conditions

**Validation Checklist**:

- [ ] Competitors analyzed (direct and indirect)
- [ ] Positioning defined (USP and differentiation strategy)
- [ ] Moat identified (competitive moat and IP strategy)
- [ ] Competitive analysis report generated
- [ ] Market positioning document created
- [ ] Defense strategy finalized

**Evidence**: EHG_Engineer@6ef8cf4:docs/workflow/stages.yaml:155-159

## Rollback Procedure

**Triggers** (from critique):
- Insufficient competitor data
- Unable to define clear USP
- No defensible moat identified

**Actions**:
1. Return to Stage 4.1 if competitor list incomplete
2. Return to Stage 4.2 if feature matrix has gaps
3. Return to Stage 4.3 if USP unclear
4. Return to Stage 3 if market validation questionable (no clear differentiation possible)
5. Escalate to Chairman if blockers persist

**Evidence**: EHG_Engineer@6ef8cf4:docs/workflow/critique/stage-04.md:46-49 (gap noted)
