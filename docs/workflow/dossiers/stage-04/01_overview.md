## Executive Summary

**Stage ID**: 4
**Title**: Competitive Intelligence & Market Defense
**Phase**: Ideation (Stages 1-10)
**Depends On**: Stage 3 (Comprehensive Validation)
**Next Stage**: 5 (Profitability Forecasting)

Stage 4 analyzes the competitive landscape and establishes market positioning strategy. Identifies direct and indirect competitors, creates feature comparison matrices, defines unique selling proposition (USP), and outlines competitive moat and IP strategy.

**Maturity**: ⚠️ Partially Implemented (Competitor identification exists, defense strategy incomplete)
**Automation Level**: Manual → Assisted (from stages.yaml notes)
**Critical Path**: Yes (market positioning blocks profitability forecasting)

**Key Metrics**: Market coverage, Competitor identification, Differentiation score
**Primary Exit Gates**: Competitors analyzed, Positioning defined, Moat identified

**Recursion Support**: ⚠️ **MINIMAL** - Recursion section header present but no details per consistency scan (Y/N/N)
