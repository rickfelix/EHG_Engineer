# Stage 17 Operating Dossier: GTM Strategist Agent Development


## Metadata
- **Category**: Guide
- **Status**: Draft
- **Version**: 1.0.0
- **Author**: DOCMON
- **Last Updated**: 2026-01-21
- **Tags**: schema, sd, directive, validation

## Executive Summary

**Stage ID**: 17
**Title**: GTM Strategist Agent Development
**Owner**: LEAD
**Overall Critique Score**: 3.0/5
**Status**: Documentation Complete

### Purpose
Deploy go-to-market strategist agent for marketing automation, enabling automated campaign development, channel management, and conversion optimization.

### Key Characteristics
- **Dependencies**: Stage 16 (Pricing Agent Development)
- **Enables**: Stage 18 (Sales Agent Development)
- **Substages**: 3 (Strategy Configuration, Campaign Development, Automation Setup)
- **Primary Metrics**: Campaign effectiveness, Lead generation, Conversion rates
- **Automation Level**: 3/5 (partial automation possible, target 80%)
- **Risk Level**: 2/5 (moderate)

### Critical Gaps Identified
1. Limited automation for manual processes (currently manual)
2. Unclear metrics thresholds (no target values defined)
3. Missing data transformation schemas
4. No rollback procedures documented
5. No customer validation touchpoint

### Strategic Context
This stage represents the venture's go-to-market automation capability, translating market strategy and pricing models (from Stage 16) into executable marketing campaigns. Success requires integration with CrewAI framework for agent orchestration and SD-RECURSION-ENGINE-001 for adaptive feedback loops.
