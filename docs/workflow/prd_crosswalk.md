## Gap Analysis

### Critical Gaps (P0)
1. **Stages 21-28**: Development phase PRDs need completion
2. **Stages 29-32**: Launch phase critical stages partially documented
3. **Integration Points**: Cross-stage data flow specifications missing

### Important Gaps (P1)
4. **Stages 33-34**: Post-launch expansion documentation
5. **Stages 35-39**: Operations phase specifications
6. **Metrics Definitions**: Concrete KPIs and thresholds not defined

### Recommendations
1. Complete all P0 PRDs within 2 weeks
2. Define integration specifications for all stages
3. Add metrics and KPI definitions to existing PRDs
4. Create P1 PRDs in second phase (weeks 3-4)
5. Validate all PRDs against implementation
