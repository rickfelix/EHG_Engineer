# Design Sub-Agent Application Expertise Enhancement

**Version**: 4.2.0
**Date**: 2025-10-03
**Status**: âœ… Complete

## Overview

Enhanced the Design sub-agent with deep knowledge of EHG application architecture to intelligently recommend optimal UI placement for new features, promote component reuse, and integrate with existing workflows.

## What Changed

### 1. Database Schema (New)

Created 5 new tables to track application architecture:

```sql
ehg_feature_areas        -- 10 major feature domains (Chairman, Ventures, Analytics, etc.)
ehg_page_routes          -- 40+ existing page routes and their purposes
ehg_component_patterns   -- Reusable UI patterns (Dashboard Card, Data Table, etc.)
ehg_user_workflows       -- Documented user journeys (Venture Create, Report Build, etc.)
ehg_design_decisions     -- Historical design decisions for learning
```

**Migration**: `database/migrations/create-ehg-application-architecture-tables.sql`

### 2. Design Agent Persona Enhancement

Updated `lib/agents/personas/sub-agents/design-agent.json`:

**New Section**: `application_expertise`
- 5-step decision framework for UI placement
- Pre-implementation questions
- Database table references
- Component reuse preference order: Reuse > Extend > Create New

**Version**: 4.1.0 â†’ 4.2.0

### 3. Context Builder Script (New)

Created `scripts/design-subagent-context-builder.js`:

**Capabilities**:
- Query application architecture for similar features
- Generate intelligent UI placement recommendations
- Identify reusable component patterns
- Map to existing user workflows
- Record design decisions for future reference

**Usage**:
```bash
# Search for similar features
node scripts/design-subagent-context-builder.js search "venture"

# Build context with recommendations
node scripts/design-subagent-context-builder.js context "New feature description" [AREA_CODE] [keywords]
```

### 4. Slash Command Update

Enhanced `.claude/commands/leo-design.md`:

**New Checklist**: Application Context Checklist (REQUIRED FIRST)
- Similar features identified
- UI placement evaluated
- Component reuse assessed
- Workflow integration planned
- Design decision documented

**New Section**: UI Placement Decision Framework
- 5-step evaluation process
- Placement options table (extend page, new page, modal, etc.)
- Pre-implementation questions

### 5. Database Record Update

Updated `leo_sub_agents` table for DESIGN sub-agent:
- Version: 4.2.0
- Application expertise: Enabled
- 4 new capabilities added
- Context builder script reference

## Decision Framework

### Step 1: Analyze Context
**Question**: What is this feature trying to accomplish?
- Query `ehg_feature_areas` for related domains
- Search `ehg_page_routes` for similar pages
- Check `ehg_user_workflows` for existing journeys

### Step 2: Evaluate Placement
**Question**: Where should this UI live?

| Option | When to Use |
|--------|-------------|
| Extend existing page | Feature complements current functionality |
| New page in existing area | Distinct but part of existing domain |
| New top-level navigation | Entirely new domain with multiple pages |
| Modal/dialog | Supporting action in existing flow |

### Step 3: Component Reuse
**Question**: Can we reuse existing components?
- Query `ehg_component_patterns` for matching patterns
- **Rule**: If existing pattern fits 80%+ of requirements â†’ REUSE
- **Preference**: Reuse > Extend > Create New

### Step 4: Workflow Integration
**Question**: How does this fit into user workflows?
- Query `ehg_user_workflows` for related journeys
- Identify natural entry/exit points

### Step 5: Document Decision
**Question**: Why did we choose this approach?
- Insert into `ehg_design_decisions` table
- Document alternatives considered

## Example Output

```bash
$ node scripts/design-subagent-context-builder.js context "New venture analytics dashboard" ANALYTICS "dashboard"

ðŸ“‹ Recommendations:
{
  "placement_options": [
    {
      "type": "feature_area_match",
      "area": "ANALYTICS",
      "navigation_path": "/analytics",
      "rationale": "Feature maps to existing Analytics & Insights domain"
    },
    {
      "type": "extend_existing_page",
      "pages": [
        {
          "route": "/analytics",
          "name": "AnalyticsDashboard",
          "purpose": "Business intelligence dashboard with charts and insights"
        }
      ],
      "rationale": "1 existing page in this area could be extended"
    }
  ],
  "component_reuse": [
    {
      "pattern": "Dashboard Card",
      "path": "src/components/ui/card.tsx",
      "examples": ["src/pages/ChairmanDashboard.tsx", "src/pages/AnalyticsDashboard.tsx"]
    }
  ],
  "workflow_integration": [
    {
      "workflow": "Build Custom Report",
      "code": "REPORT_BUILD",
      "suggestion": "Consider integrating with 'Build Custom Report' workflow"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Pre-Implementation Questions

The Design sub-agent will now ask:
1. "Is there a similar feature in [FEATURE_AREA]?"
2. "Can this extend the existing [PAGE_NAME] instead of creating new page?"
3. "Does this fit into the [WORKFLOW_NAME] user workflow?"
4. "Are there existing [PATTERN_NAME] components we can reuse?"
5. "Would users expect to find this in [NAVIGATION_PATH]?"
6. "Is this better as a tab, modal, or separate page?"

## Success Metrics

âœ… Design sub-agent can answer: "Where should this UI go?"
âœ… Evaluates existing workflows before proposing new pages
âœ… Recommends component reuse over new creation
âœ… Flags when features fit into existing domains
âœ… Prevents duplicate UI for similar features
âœ… Documents all design decisions for future reference

## Files Modified

1. âœ… `database/migrations/create-ehg-application-architecture-tables.sql` (NEW)
2. âœ… `scripts/seed-ehg-application-architecture.js` (NEW)
3. âœ… `scripts/design-subagent-context-builder.js` (NEW)
4. âœ… `lib/agents/personas/sub-agents/design-agent.json` (UPDATED - v4.2.0)
5. âœ… `.claude/commands/leo-design.md` (UPDATED)
6. âœ… Database: `leo_sub_agents` table (UPDATED - DESIGN record)

## Testing

```bash
# Test 1: Search for similar features
node scripts/design-subagent-context-builder.js search "venture"
# Result: âœ… Found 3 similar features

# Test 2: Build context with recommendations
node scripts/design-subagent-context-builder.js context "New venture analytics dashboard" ANALYTICS "dashboard"
# Result: âœ… Generated placement recommendations, component reuse suggestions, workflow integration

# Test 3: Verify database tables
psql -c "SELECT tablename FROM pg_tables WHERE tablename LIKE 'ehg_%'"
# Result: âœ… All 5 tables created
```

## Next Steps

1. **Expand Seeded Data**: Add more page routes as application grows
2. **Historical Analysis**: Populate `ehg_design_decisions` with past decisions
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Build ML model to suggest patterns based on feature descriptions
4. **Workflow Mapping**: Document all user workflows in the application
5. **Integration**: Auto-trigger context builder during PLAN phase PRD creation

## Usage in LEO Protocol

When a Strategic Directive enters PLAN phase with UI/UX requirements:

1. **Automatic Trigger**: Design sub-agent activates
2. **Context Query**: Runs `design-subagent-context-builder.js`
3. **Analysis**: Evaluates placement options, component reuse, workflow integration
4. **Recommendations**: Presents options to PLAN agent
5. **Decision**: PLAN agent selects approach with Design sub-agent guidance
6. **Documentation**: Decision recorded in `ehg_design_decisions`
7. **Handoff**: Complete UI/UX specs with placement rationale to EXEC

## Benefits

- **Consistency**: Ensures similar features use similar UI patterns
- **Efficiency**: Promotes component reuse over duplication
- **User Experience**: Integrates new features into existing workflows naturally
- **Knowledge Retention**: Documents design decisions for future reference
- **Onboarding**: New team members can query past decisions for guidance
- **Scalability**: As application grows, knowledge base grows with it
