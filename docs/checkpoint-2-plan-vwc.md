## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Unit Tests (Day 1-2, 5 hours)

**Day 1: Adapter Tests (3 hours)**
1. Set up test file: `tests/unit/opportunityToVentureAdapter.test.ts`
2. Implement 12 test scenarios (see US-005)
3. Run tests locally and verify coverage
4. Fix any failing tests
5. Commit: `test(SD-VWC-002): Add opportunityToVentureAdapter unit tests (12 scenarios, 90%+ coverage)`

**Day 2: Dashboard Tests (2 hours)**
1. Set up test file: `tests/unit/OpportunitySourcingDashboard.test.tsx`
2. Implement 7 test scenarios (see US-006)
3. Run tests locally and verify coverage
4. Fix any failing tests
5. Commit: `test(SD-VWC-002): Add OpportunitySourcingDashboard unit tests (7 scenarios, 80%+ coverage)`

### Phase 2: Accessibility (Day 3, 4 hours)

**Day 3 Morning: Keyboard Navigation (2.5 hours)**
1. Audit current keyboard navigation (use Tab through wizard)
2. Add missing tabIndex attributes where needed
3. Implement skip links if needed
4. Test keyboard-only workflow (Idea → Research → Results → Review → Confirm)
5. Verify focus indicators visible
6. Commit: `feat(SD-VWC-002): Add keyboard navigation support to venture wizard`

**Day 3 Afternoon: ARIA Labels (1.5 hours)**
1. Audit with WAVE checker (https://wave.webaim.org/extension/)
2. Add missing aria-labels to buttons
3. Add aria-describedby to form fields
4. Implement aria-live regions for dynamic content
5. Add aria-busy, aria-pressed, aria-current as needed
6. Re-run WAVE checker: target 0 critical errors
7. Commit: `feat(SD-VWC-002): Add ARIA labels and screen reader support`

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- **Framework**: Vitest (already configured)
- **Coverage Target**: 80%+ overall, 90%+ for adapter
- **Run Command**: `npm run test:unit`
- **CI Integration**: Tests must pass in Pre-Merge Verification

### Accessibility Testing
- **Manual**: Keyboard-only navigation walkthrough
- **Automated**: WAVE browser extension
- **Screen Reader**: NVDA (Windows) or VoiceOver (Mac) spot check
- **CI Integration**: Consider adding axe-core automated checks

---

## Risk Assessment

### Risks Identified

**1. Adapter Test Complexity** (Medium Risk)
- **Issue**: Adapter may have complex transformation logic
- **Mitigation**: Start with simple cases, build up to complex
- **Fallback**: Focus on critical paths first, defer edge cases

**2. Dashboard Test Mocking** (Medium Risk)
- **Issue**: Component may have complex dependencies (Supabase, hooks)
- **Mitigation**: Use Vitest mocking, mock external dependencies
- **Fallback**: Focus on pure UI logic, defer integration tests

**3. Pre-existing Accessibility Issues** (Low Risk)
- **Issue**: WAVE may find pre-existing errors not related to wizard
- **Mitigation**: Focus on wizard components only, document pre-existing
- **Fallback**: Create separate SD for codebase-wide a11y (like lint issues)

**4. Keyboard Navigation Conflicts** (Low Risk)
- **Issue**: Third-party components (Radix UI) may have own keyboard handling
- **Mitigation**: Test thoroughly, leverage Radix keyboard support
- **Fallback**: Document any known limitations
