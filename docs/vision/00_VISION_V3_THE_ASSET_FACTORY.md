**Status:** RATIFIED
**Date:** January 1, 2026
**Supersedes:** 00_VISION_V2_CHAIRMAN_OS.md
**Authority:** This document is the "Constitution" for all EHG agents and development.

---

## Version History

| Version | Date | Changes |
|---------|------|---------|
| 3.2 | 2026-01-01 | Solo Chairman refinement: Added Chairman's Operating Model, Exit/Flip Strategy (Phase 8), Seed Agent pattern, Bootstrap Strategy. Revised Stage 35 to "as-needed" autonomy. Updated success metrics to 30+ ventures / $200K MRR target. Removed AURORA in favor of EVA consolidation. |
| 3.1 | 2026-01-01 | Triangulation amendments: Removed AURORA (EVA does it all), added Budget Firewall, added Sunset Protocol, added instrumentation requirements. |
| 3.0 | 2026-01-01 | Paradigm shift from "Code Factory" to "Asset Factory". Integrated Maintenance, Marketing, and Distribution layers. |

---

## Executive Summary

**V2 built a system that creates code.**
**V3 builds a system that creates wealth.**
**V3.2 builds a system that creates wealth FOR A SOLO CHAIRMAN.**

The critical constraint: **Rick is the only human.** No developers. No marketing team. No support staff. The system must be fully autonomous with Chairman oversight, not Chairman labor.

The shift:
- V2 asked: "Can we generate ventures?"
- V3 asked: "Can we generate revenue while the Chairman sleeps?"
- V3.2 asks: "Can we generate **sellable assets** while the Chairman allocates?"

## The Chairman's Operating Model

This section codifies the Chairman's preferences as determined through direct Q&A on January 1, 2026.

### The Solo Chairman Constraint

| Dimension | Chairman's Answer | System Implication |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Autonomy Level** | As needed | No fixed limits. Involvement scales with venture complexity. |
| **Approval Model** | Before publish, batched daily | Nothing goes live without Chairman review. Daily digest, not real-time. |
| **Bootstrap Method** | Claude Code builds | LEO Protocol is the builder. No contractors. |
| **Incident Response** | Auto-pause, fix in morning | Accept short downtime. State preservation over 24/7 uptime. |
| **Marketing Automation** | Full funnel | AI handles content, ads, email, retargeting. Chairman sets budgets. |
| **Venture Variety** | Same stack, varied models | Next.js + Supabase always. Business models can differ. |
| **Customer Support** | AI + escalate to Chairman | Chairman is the human fallback for edge cases. |
| **Budget Structure** | Per-venture hard caps | Ventures are financially isolated. No cross-subsidization. |
| **Agent Architecture** | Seed Agent pattern | Build the meta-agent that builds other agents. |
| **Target Timeline** | Q2 2026 | First autonomous revenue by end of June. |
| **Portfolio Scale** | 30+ ventures, $200K MRR | High volume factory. Many small bets. |
| **Brand Control** | AI autonomous | Chairman intervenes only if something feels wrong. |
| **Code Maintenance** | Auto-fix + canary | AI fixes, canary deploys, rollback on failure. |
| **Legal Docs** | AI drafts, Chairman reviews | No lawyer. Template-based with Chairman approval. |
| **Safety Layer** | Trust EVA | No separate watchdog. EVA self-monitors. |
| **Exit Strategy** | Active flip model | Build to sell. Target 2-3x annual revenue. |

[ Edit    ]              [ Reject ]
```

**Rule:** Nothing publishes until Chairman sees morning digest and approves.

## The Paradigm Shift

### V2: The Software Factory

```
Seed Idea → Code → Deployment → ???
                              ↑
                        (Chairman's Problem)
```

### V3.2: The Asset Flip Factory

```
Seed Idea → Validated Product → Paying Customers → Maintained System → SALE
                                                                         ↓
                                                              (Chairman's Payday)
```

**Key Insight:** Ventures are not meant to be held forever. They are assets to flip.

---

## 1. The Core Philosophy (Revised)

We are not building a **Command Center**. We are not building a **Holding Company**.
We are building a **Venture Flip Factory**.

The system is designed to:
1. **Create** ventures rapidly (Genesis)
2. **Validate** ventures with real revenue (Phase 1-6)
3. **Automate** ventures to run without Chairman labor (Phase 7)
4. **Sell** ventures at 2-3x annual revenue (Phase 8)
5. **Repeat** with learnings fed back into the factory

### The Chairman's True Role

The Chairman is not a developer. Not a marketer. Not a support agent.

**The Chairman is a Portfolio Manager who builds assets to sell.**

| Old Role (V2) | New Role (V3.2) |
|---------------|-----------------|
| Approve code changes | Approve strategic bets |
| Review stage artifacts | Review daily digest |
| Decide on pivots | Decide on acquisitions and exits |
| Manage EVA | Collect proceeds from flips |

---

## 2. The Full-Stack Venture Lifecycle

V2 covered Stages 1-25 (Ideation → Deployment).
V3 extended to Stages 26-35 (Growth → Autonomy).
**V3.2 extends to Stages 36-40 (Exit → Reinvestment).**

### The Nine Phases

| Phase | Name | Stages | Purpose | Status |
|-------|------|--------|---------|--------|
| 0 | THE FORGE | — | Build the factory itself | Active |
| 1 | THE TRUTH | 1-5 | Validation & Market Reality | Built |
| 2 | THE ENGINE | 6-9 | Business Model Foundation | Built |
| 3 | THE IDENTITY | 10-12 | Brand & Go-to-Market | Built |
| 4 | THE BLUEPRINT | 13-16 | Technical Architecture | Built |
| 5 | THE BUILD | 17-20 | Implementation | Built |
| 6 | THE LAUNCH | 21-25 | Deployment & Optimization | Built |
| 7 | THE MACHINE | 26-35 | Growth, Maintenance, Autonomy | In Progress |
| **8** | **THE EXIT** | **36-40** | **Sale, Transfer, Reinvestment** | **NEW** |

### Phase 0: THE FORGE (Bootstrap)

Before we can run ventures, we must build the factory.

**Current State (January 2026):**

| Component | Status | Gap |
|-----------|--------|-----|
| Genesis Pipeline | 80% | PRD generation stubbed |
| Pattern Library | 90% | 49 patterns, needs Seed Agent |
| LEO Protocol | 95% | Operational |
| Marketing Automation | 0% | Not started |
| Support Automation | 0% | Not started |
| Seed Agent | 0% | The meta-agent that builds agents |

**Bootstrap Strategy:**
1. Claude Code builds first 2-3 ventures via LEO Protocol
2. Ventures are "Wizard of Oz" shells with AI-generated flavor
3. Revenue validates the model
4. Seed Agent is built to scale venture creation
5. Factory becomes self-sustaining

**Exit Criteria for Phase 0:**
- [ ] Seed Agent can spawn new agents from prompts
- [ ] First venture generates $1 autonomous revenue
- [ ] Marketing automation handles one funnel end-to-end

### Phase 7: THE MACHINE (Stages 26-35)

| Stage | Title | Purpose | Owner |
|-------|-------|---------|-------|
| 26 | Content Engine Setup | SEO, blog, social presence | VP_GROWTH |
| 27 | Paid Acquisition Pipeline | Ads, funnels, landing pages | VP_GROWTH |
| 28 | Customer Success Automation | Onboarding, retention, NPS | VP_GROWTH |
| 29 | Support & Incident Automation | Ticketing, triage, resolution | VP_OPS |
| 30 | Bug Detection & Auto-Fix | Monitoring, alerts, remediation | VP_OPS |
| 31 | Feature Request Pipeline | User feedback → PRD → Implementation | VP_PRODUCT |
| 32 | Pattern Library Feedback | Venture learnings → Pattern updates | VP_TECH |
| 33 | Revenue Optimization | Pricing tests, upsell, churn prevention | VP_GROWTH |
| 34 | Portfolio Synergy | Cross-venture opportunities | CEO |
| 35 | Autonomy Certification | Venture runs with minimal intervention | CHAIRMAN |

### Phase 8: THE EXIT (Stages 36-40) — NEW

| Stage | Title | Purpose | Owner |
|-------|-------|---------|-------|
| 36 | Sale Readiness Audit | Documentation, metrics, legal cleanup | VP_OPS |
| 37 | Valuation & Listing | Price determination, marketplace listing | CHAIRMAN |
| 38 | Due Diligence Package | Buyer questions, data room, demos | VP_OPS |
| 39 | Transfer & Handoff | Asset transfer, training, transition | VP_TECH |
| 40 | Reinvestment Allocation | Proceeds → Pattern Library → New Ventures | CHAIRMAN |

---

## 3. Stage 35: Autonomy Certification (Revised)

A venture reaches Stage 35 when Chairman involvement drops to **as-needed oversight**.

### Quantified Autonomy

| Criteria | Threshold |
|----------|-----------|
| Revenue | Positive MRR for 3 consecutive months |
| Support | <10% tickets require Chairman escalation |
| Bugs | Auto-fixed via canary deploy with rollback |
| Growth | Customer acquisition funnel running |
| Maintenance | Updates deploy without Chairman labor |
| Chairman Time | **As needed** (no fixed limit) |

### What "Autonomous" Means in V3.2

**Old Definition (V3.1):** "No human intervention required"
**New Definition (V3.2):** "Chairman involvement only when Chairman chooses"

The Chairman may choose to spend 10 hours/month on a high-growth venture or 0 hours on a stable one. The point is **choice, not constraint**.

### Auto-Pause Incident Model

When something breaks:
1. System detects failure
2. System auto-pauses affected components
3. System preserves state (no data loss)
4. System sends morning digest notification
5. Chairman fixes when convenient

**Accepted tradeoff:** Short downtime is acceptable. State preservation is not negotiable.

---

## 4. Stage 40: Exit & Reinvestment (NEW)

When a venture is ready to sell:

### Sale Readiness Checklist

| Category | Requirement |
|----------|-------------|
| **Revenue** | 6+ months of consistent MRR |
| **Documentation** | All code documented, no tribal knowledge |
| **Autonomy** | Stage 35 certified (runs without founder) |
| **Legal** | Clean IP, ToS, Privacy Policy |
| **Metrics** | CAC, LTV, churn, MRR all instrumented |
| **Tech Debt** | No critical debt, dependencies updated |

### Valuation Model

**Target Multiple:** 2-3x Annual Revenue (ARR)

| Venture Profile | Multiple |
|-----------------|----------|
| Growing MRR, high retention | 3x ARR |
| Stable MRR, moderate retention | 2.5x ARR |
| Flat/declining, high churn | 2x ARR or less |

### Listing Channels

- Acquire.com (primary)
- MicroAcquire
- Flippa (for smaller ventures)
- Direct outreach to strategic buyers

### Reinvestment Loop

```
Sale Proceeds
      │

┌─────────────────────┐
│  ALLOCATION SPLIT   │
│                     │
│  40% → Pattern Lib  │  (Improve the factory)
│  40% → New Ventures │  (Fuel new bets)
│  20% → Chairman     │  (Take profits)
└─────────────────────┘
```

---

## 5. The Seed Agent Pattern

### The Bootstrap Paradox

To build ventures automatically, we need agents.
To build agents, we need... agents?

### The Solution: One Agent to Rule Them All

The **Seed Agent** is a meta-agent whose only job is to spawn other agents.

```
Chairman: "I need a Twitter marketing agent"
     │
     ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                         SEED AGENT                                  │
│   Input: Natural language description of needed agent               │
│   Output: Working agent code + deployment                           │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Generated: twitter-marketing-agent.py
     │
     ▼
Deployed to Agent Platform
     │
     ▼
Agent begins operating autonomously
```

### Seed Agent Capabilities

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Agent Generation | Creates new agents from prompts |
| Template Library | Pre-built patterns for common agent types |
| Deployment | Pushes new agents to the Agent Platform |
| Testing | Validates agent behavior before deployment |
| Documentation | Auto-generates agent specs |

### Priority Order

1. **First:** Build the Seed Agent
2. **Then:** Use Seed Agent to build marketing agents
3. **Then:** Use Seed Agent to build support agents
4. **Then:** Use Seed Agent to build maintenance agents

---

## 6. The Venture Stack Constraint

### Same Stack, Varied Models

All EHG ventures use the same technical foundation:

| Layer | Standard |
|-------|----------|
| Frontend | Next.js 14+ |
| Backend | Next.js API Routes + Supabase |
| Database | Supabase (PostgreSQL) |
| Auth | Supabase Auth |
| Hosting | Vercel |
| Payments | Stripe |
| Email | Resend or SendGrid |
| Analytics | PostHog or Plausible |

### Why Same Stack?

1. **Pattern Reuse** — Every pattern works across all ventures
2. **Maintenance Efficiency** — One upgrade path, not 30
3. **Seed Agent Simplicity** — Generate code for one stack, not many
4. **Chairman Familiarity** — Review code you understand

### Varied Business Models

While tech is standardized, business models can vary:

| Model Type | Example |
|------------|---------|
| SaaS Subscription | Monthly/annual recurring |
| Usage-Based | Pay per API call |
| Marketplace | Transaction fees |
| Freemium | Free tier + paid upgrade |
| One-Time Purchase | Lifetime access |

---

## 7. The Three Automation Layers

### Layer A: Marketing Automation (Stages 26-28)

**Problem Solved:** "Who finds the customers?"

| Component | Purpose | Automation Level |
|-----------|---------|------------------|
| Content Engine | SEO + thought leadership | Full (AI generates) |
| Landing Pages | Convert visitors | Full (template-driven) |
| Paid Acquisition | Scalable traffic | Full (AI manages within budget) |
| Email Sequences | Nurture leads | Full (behavior-triggered) |

**Chairman Role:** Set budgets, approve daily digest of pending content/ads.

### Layer B: Maintenance Automation (Stages 29-32)

**Problem Solved:** "Who fixes the bugs?"

| Component | Purpose | Automation Level |
|-----------|---------|------------------|
| Error Monitoring | Detect issues | Full (Sentry integration) |
| Auto-Triage | Classify severity | Full (AI classification) |
| Auto-Fix Pipeline | Resolve issues | Full (canary + rollback) |
| Pattern Feedback | Learn from fixes | Full (updates library) |

**The Maintenance Loop:**
```
Error Detected (Sentry)
        ↓
Auto-Triage (AI classifies severity/type)
        ↓
Pattern Match (Is this a known issue type?)
        │
    ┌───┴───┐
    │       │
 [YES]    [NO]
    │       │
    ▼       ▼
Auto-Fix   Create SD
(Apply     (New work
pattern)   for crew)
    │       │
    └───┬───┘
        ↓
Canary Deploy
        ↓
Tests Pass? → Promote to Production
        ↓
Update Pattern Library
```

**Chairman Role:** Review morning logs, rollback if needed.

### Layer C: Support Automation (Stages 28-29)

**Problem Solved:** "Who helps the customers?"

| Component | Purpose | Automation Level |
|-----------|---------|------------------|
| FAQ/Docs | Self-serve answers | Full (AI-generated) |
| Chat Bot | First-line support | Full (RAG-based) |
| Ticket Triage | Classify requests | Full (AI routing) |
| Escalation | Complex issues | Chairman inbox |

**Chairman Role:** Handle <10% of tickets that require human judgment.

## 8. The PRD Evolution

V2 PRDs focused on **what to build**.
V3 PRDs include **how to grow**.
V3.2 PRDs include **how to exit**.

### V3.2 PRD Structure

```typescript
interface PRD_V3_2 {
  // V2 Fields (Unchanged)
  executive_summary: string;
  problem_statement: string;
  target_users: UserPersona[];
  functional_requirements: Requirement[];
  technical_requirements: Requirement[];
  success_metrics: Metric[];

  // V3 Fields (Growth)
  go_to_market: {
    primary_channel: 'content' | 'paid' | 'viral' | 'partnerships';
    content_strategy: ContentPlan;
    ad_budget_monthly: number;
    max_monthly_budget: number;      // Hard ceiling
    daily_stop_loss: number;         // Auto-pause threshold
    target_cac: number;

    retention_hooks: string[];
  };

  autonomy_target: {
    target_stage_35_date: string;
    revenue_target_for_autonomy: number;
  };

  // V3.2 Fields (Exit) — NEW
  exit_profile: {
    target_exit_date: string;        // When to list for sale
    target_multiple: number;         // 2-3x ARR
    ideal_buyer_profile: string;     // Who would buy this?
    strategic_value: string[];       // Why it's worth buying
    transferability_score: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low';
  };
}
```

---

## 9. Budget Structure

### Per-Venture Hard Caps

Each venture operates within strict financial isolation:

```typescript
interface VentureBudget {
  venture_id: string;

  // Monthly Caps
  max_monthly_ad_spend: number;
  max_monthly_api_costs: number;
  max_monthly_infrastructure: number;

  // Daily Limits
  daily_ad_stop_loss: number;
  daily_api_stop_loss: number;

  // Lifetime Limits
  total_investment_cap: number;      // Kill venture if exceeded without profit

  // Alerts
  alert_at_percentage: number;       // Alert Chairman at 80% of cap
}
```

### No Cross-Subsidization

If Venture A is profitable and Venture B is burning cash:
- Venture B cannot borrow from Venture A's budget
- Each venture lives or dies on its own
- Chairman can manually reallocate, but system cannot

## 11. Triangulation Amendments (All Rounds)

### Round 1 Amendments (V3.1)

#### Amendment 1: The Budget Firewall (Antigravity)
Hard limits on marketing spend. Daily stop-loss triggers auto-pause.

#### Amendment 2: The Sunset Protocol (Antigravity)
Kill criteria for failing ventures. The Graveyard for archived learnings. (Specific criteria TBD via research.)

#### Amendment 3: Instrumentation Baseline (OpenAI)
Required dashboards before Stage 35 certification.

#### Amendment 4: Deterministic Demo Mode (OpenAI)
Predictable, repeatable demos for the Feb 14 Exhibition.

#### Amendment 5: Chairman Veto on Brand Voice (Antigravity)
Chairman can intervene on brand decisions, but AI generates autonomously by default.

### Round 2 Amendments (V3.2)

#### Amendment 6: Bootstrap Strategy
Phase 0 (THE FORGE) acknowledges current state. Claude Code builds first ventures.

#### Amendment 7: Exception-Only Autonomy (Refined)
Stage 35 = "as needed" involvement, not "zero involvement."

#### Amendment 8: REJECTED — No Separate Watchdog
Chairman trusts EVA. No redundant safety layer.

#### Amendment 9: Daily Batch Approval
Chairman reviews morning digest. Nothing publishes without approval.

#### Amendment 10: Same Stack, Varied Models
Next.js + Supabase always. Business models can differ.

#### Amendment 11: Exit Strategy (Phase 8)
Build to sell. Target 2-3x ARR. Reinvestment loop defined.

#### Amendment 12: Seed Agent Priority
Build the meta-agent before building specialized agents.

### Why One Brain, Not Two

The original V3 draft proposed a separate "AURORA" agent for revenue operations. This was rejected during triangulation for:

1. **Simpler Architecture** - One orchestrator, no coordination overhead
2. **Faster Implementation** - Extend EVA, don't build new agent
3. **Unified Interface** - Chairman talks to EVA only
4. **Scale Later** - Split when portfolio exceeds 10 ventures, not before

## 13. The Shadow Work (Formalized)

The following gaps identified during the Jan 1, 2026 audit are now **formal requirements** for Exhibition readiness.

### Integration Shadows

| Shadow | Description | Resolution |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| Stage 16/17 Orphan | soul-extractor.js and production-generator.js not wired to UI | Create API endpoints, wire to Stage16/17 components |
| PRD Stub | generatePRD() returns template, not LLM output | Wire OpenAI to genesis-pipeline.js |
| Genesis UI | No visual interface for simulation creation | Build Chairman-accessible Genesis creation form |

### Infrastructure Shadows

| Shadow | Description | Resolution |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| Hardcoded Secrets | JWT_SECRET in .env.production | Implement secret rotation |
| Empty Sentry | SENTRY_DSN is blank | Configure error monitoring |
| No Prod CI/CD | Deployment is manual | Create production workflow |
| Security Headers | No CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options | Add middleware |

## 14. The Feb 14, 2026 Exhibition Standard

**Definition of "Done" for the Fleet Exhibition:**

### Tier 1: Must Have (Blocking)

| Requirement | Verification |
|-------------|--------------|
| Genesis creates ventures via UI | Chairman can click "Create Venture" and see simulation |
| PRD is LLM-generated, not template | Unique PRD for "Uber for Dog Walking" vs "AI Legal Assistant" |
| Ventures visible in portfolio | Chairman sees all simulations in dashboard |
| Stage progression works | Can advance venture through stages 1-5 minimum |
| No white screens | All primary flows render without errors |
| No hardcoded secrets | Security audit passes |
| Demo produces consistent output | Deterministic demo mode |

### Tier 2: Should Have (Quality)

| Requirement | Verification |
|-------------|--------------|
| Error monitoring live | Sentry captures errors |
| Bulk actions work | Can pause/archive multiple ventures |
| Empty states are clear | User knows "loading" vs "no data" |
| Stage 16/17 integration | Soul extraction triggers from UI |

### Tier 3: Nice to Have (Polish)

| Requirement | Verification |
|-------------|--------------|
| Marketing DNA in PRD | PRD includes go_to_market section |
| Maintenance DNA in PRD | PRD includes maintenance_profile |
| Exit DNA in PRD | PRD includes exit_profile section |

## 15. The Oath (V3.2)

**V2 Oath:** "Rick commands, EVA coordinates, Crews execute."

**V3 Oath:** "Ventures create themselves. Ventures market themselves. Ventures maintain themselves."

**V3.2 Oath:**

> "We build assets to flip.
> The factory never stops.
> One venture sells, another is born.
> The Chairman allocates.
> The system delivers."
