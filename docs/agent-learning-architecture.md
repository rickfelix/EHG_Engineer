## üîÑ Learning Feedback Loops

### 1. **Sub-Agent Pattern Learning**
Sub-agents continuously learn from their analyses:

- **False Positive Recognition**: Identifies patterns that typically result in false alarms
- **True Positive Enhancement**: Recognizes reliable indicators of real issues
- **Confidence Calibration**: Improves confidence scoring based on historical accuracy
- **Fix Pattern Learning**: Remembers successful resolution strategies

### 2. **Main Agent Workflow Learning**
The system tracks complete decision chains:

```
LEAD Decision ‚Üí PLAN Complexity ‚Üí EXEC Quality ‚Üí Business Outcome
```

Each workflow generates learning data:
- **Decision Effectiveness**: How well strategic decisions translate to outcomes
- **Complexity Prediction**: Accuracy of technical complexity estimates
- **Quality Correlation**: Relationship between implementation quality and user satisfaction

### 3. **Cross-Agent Intelligence**
Agents share insights across projects:

- **Pattern Recognition**: Similar project patterns and their outcomes
- **Risk Prediction**: Early warning systems based on historical data
- **Resource Optimization**: Better estimates based on past similar work
- **Success Factor Analysis**: What makes projects succeed or fail
