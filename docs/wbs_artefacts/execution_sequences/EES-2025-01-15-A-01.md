## EES Metadata

- **EES-ID**: EES-2025-01-15-A-01
- **Parent Directive**: SD-2025-01-15-A
- **Title**: Platform Foundation Setup
- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Priority**: CRITICAL
- **Created Date**: 2025-01-15
- **Target Completion**: 2025-01-20

## Strategic Alignment

### Parent Directive Context
This EES implements the foundational setup phase of the EHG_Engineer platform, establishing the basic project structure and environment configuration.

### Contribution to Strategic Goal
Establishes the clean, minimal foundation required for LEO Protocol implementation without the complexity of the full EHG platform.

### Success Criteria from SD
- [x] Complete LEO Protocol v3.1.5 implementation
- [x] Functional database schema with strategic directives
- [x] Working agent communication protocols
- [x] Template system for creating new strategic directives
- [x] End-to-end workflow validation

## Epic Implementation Details

### Objective
Create the foundational project structure, environment configuration, and basic LEO Protocol implementation for EHG_Engineer.

### Scope
- Project directory structure and configuration
- Package.json with minimal dependencies
- Environment configuration (.env template)
- Basic database connection test
- LEO Protocol documentation integration
- Cursor rules for development guidance

### Key Deliverables
1. Complete project directory structure
2. Package.json with essential dependencies
3. Environment configuration template
4. Database connection test script
5. LEO Protocol documentation
6. Cursor rules for development

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Project directory structure created and organized
- [x] Package.json created with minimal dependencies
- [x] Environment configuration template created
- [x] Database connection test working
- [x] LEO Protocol documentation in place
- [x] Cursor rules configured for development
- [x] All Phase 1 validation checks passing

## Implementation Plan

### Technical Approach
Extract essential components from EHG platform while maintaining clean separation and minimal complexity.

### Dependencies
- **Prerequisite EES**: None (this is the first EES)
- **External Dependencies**: Supabase database access
- **Technical Dependencies**: Node.js environment, npm package manager

### Risk Factors
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Missing dependencies | HIGH | Use minimal, proven dependencies only |
| Database connection issues | HIGH | Test connection thoroughly |
| Protocol compliance gaps | HIGH | Follow LEO Protocol exactly |

## HAP Block Breakdown

### Completed HAP Blocks
- **HAP-FOUNDATION-01**: Project structure creation ✅
- **HAP-FOUNDATION-02**: Package configuration ✅
- **HAP-FOUNDATION-03**: Environment setup ✅

### Estimated Effort
- **Total Effort**: 3 HAP blocks (COMPLETED)
- **Estimated Duration**: 3 days (COMPLETED)
- **Resource Requirements**: EXEC agent with Node.js knowledge

## Validation Plan

### Testing Strategy
- Verify all directories and files created
- Test database connection
- Validate package.json dependencies
- Confirm LEO Protocol documentation accessible

### Success Verification
- All Phase 1 validation checks passing
- Database connection test successful
- Project structure matches requirements
- Documentation complete and accessible

### Quality Gates
- [x] Project structure complete
- [x] Package.json configured
- [x] Environment template created
- [x] Database connection working
- [x] Documentation in place
