# LEO Protocol v3.3.0 - Boundary Enforcement, Context Management & Specialized Skills

**Status**: Critical Enhancement
**Date**: 2025-08-30
**Based On**: User Feedback on EXEC Agent Behavior

---

## Executive Summary

This enhancement addresses three critical issues:
1. **EXEC agents taking excessive liberties** outside SD/PRD boundaries
2. **Context window management** not being tracked or optimized
3. **Specialized sub-agent skills** not being utilized effectively

---

## Part 1: Agent Boundary Enforcement

### The Problem
EXEC agents sometimes interpret requirements creatively, going beyond the scope defined by LEAD (SD) and PLAN (PRD), which can lead to:
- Scope creep
- Unexpected implementations
- Wasted effort on out-of-scope features
- Confusion about deliverables

### Boundary Definition Framework

#### 1.1 LEAD Agent Boundaries
```yaml
lead_boundaries:
  must_stay_within:
    - Business objectives and constraints
    - Resource limitations (time, budget, people)
    - Strategic company direction
    - Compliance and regulatory requirements
    
  cannot_do:
    - Change fundamental business requirements
    - Ignore stakeholder constraints
    - Create technical specifications
    - Make implementation decisions
    
  creative_freedom:
    - How to frame the problem
    - Success metric definitions
    - Risk assessment approach
    - Prioritization of objectives
```

#### 1.2 PLAN Agent Boundaries
```yaml
plan_boundaries:
  must_stay_within:
    - Strategic Directive objectives
    - Technical feasibility constraints
    - Existing system architecture
    - Performance requirements
    
  cannot_do:
    - Change business objectives
    - Ignore SD requirements
    - Make business decisions
    - Implement code
    
  creative_freedom:
    - Technical approach selection
    - Architecture decisions (within constraints)
    - Tool and framework choices
    - Implementation sequencing
```

#### 1.3 EXEC Agent Boundaries (CRITICAL)
```yaml
exec_boundaries:
  must_stay_within:
    - PRD technical specifications
    - Defined acceptance criteria
    - Approved technology stack
    - Performance targets
    - Code style guidelines
    
  cannot_do:
    - Add features not in PRD
    - Change architecture decisions
    - Use unapproved technologies
    - Ignore test requirements
    - Skip defined steps
    
  creative_freedom:
    - Implementation details (algorithms, data structures)
    - Code organization (within architecture)
    - Error handling approaches
    - Optimization techniques
    - Testing strategies (meeting coverage requirements)
```

### Boundary Enforcement Mechanism

```markdown
## EXEC Boundary Check Protocol

Before implementing ANYTHING, EXEC must verify:

1. **Is this in the PRD?**
   - [ ] Feature explicitly mentioned
   - [ ] Requirement documented
   - [ ] Success criteria defined

2. **Is this in scope?**
   - [ ] Within technical specifications
   - [ ] Using approved technologies
   - [ ] Following defined architecture

3. **Is this creative addition valuable?**
   - [ ] Enhances PRD requirement (not replaces)
   - [ ] Doesn't add complexity
   - [ ] Doesn't increase timeline
   - [ ] Has clear value proposition

If ANY answer is NO → STOP and request clarification
```

## Part 2: Context Window Management

### The Challenge
LLM context windows are limited. Poor management leads to:
- Lost information from earlier in conversation
- Repeated work
- Inconsistent decisions
- Degraded performance

### Context Window Strategy

#### 2.1 Context Priority System
```yaml
context_priority:
  tier_1_critical: # Never drop these
    - Current Strategic Directive
    - Active PRD section
    - Current task checklist
    - Active error states
    - Handoff requirements
    
  tier_2_important: # Keep if possible
    - Recent decisions made
    - Test results
    - Configuration details
    - Dependencies list
    - Recent code changes
    
  tier_3_helpful: # Drop if needed
    - Historical conversation
    - Completed task details
    - Old error messages
    - Previous iterations
    - Example code
```

#### 2.2 Context Management Protocol
```markdown
## Context Window Management Rules

### At Each Handoff:
1. **Summarize completed work** (max 500 tokens)
2. **Extract key decisions** (bullet points)
3. **Drop verbose history** (keep only summaries)
4. **Preserve critical references** (file paths, IDs)

### During Long Tasks:
1. **Checkpoint every 30 minutes**
   - Save current state
   - Summarize progress
   - Clear old context
   
2. **Use external storage**
   - Write summaries to files
   - Reference instead of include
   - Use file paths not content

### Context Budget:
- Strategic Directive: 1,000 tokens max
- PRD: 2,000 tokens max  
- Current task: 1,000 tokens max
- Code context: 3,000 tokens max
- Conversation history: 2,000 tokens max
- Reserve: 1,000 tokens

Total Budget: ~10,000 tokens (safe margin)
```

#### 2.3 Context Compression Techniques
```markdown
## Compression Strategies

1. **Summarization**
   - Long explanations → bullet points
   - Verbose errors → key message only
   - Multiple attempts → final solution only

2. **Externalization**
   - Code → file references
   - Logs → summary + file path
   - Data → statistics not full sets

3. **Deduplication**
   - Remove repeated information
   - Consolidate similar items
   - Use references to earlier mentions

4. **Prioritization**
   - Keep only active/relevant items
   - Archive completed tasks
   - Remove outdated information
```

### Sub-Agent Activation Protocol

```markdown
## When to Activate Sub-Agents

### Automatic Activation (based on PRD keywords):
- "security" → Security Sub-Agent
- "performance" → Performance Sub-Agent
- "design" or "UI" → Design Sub-Agent
- "database" or "schema" → Database Sub-Agent
- "test" or "coverage" → Testing Sub-Agent

### Manual Activation (EXEC decision):
IF task complexity > threshold THEN
  IF security_risk > low THEN activate Security Sub-Agent
  IF ui_complexity > medium THEN activate Design Sub-Agent
  IF data_complexity > medium THEN activate Database Sub-Agent
  IF performance_critical THEN activate Performance Sub-Agent
END IF

### Sub-Agent Collaboration:
- Sub-agents can work in parallel
- Results consolidated by main EXEC
- Conflicts resolved by PLAN agent
- Handoffs include sub-agent reports
```

## Part 5: Enforcement and Monitoring

### Boundary Violation Detection

```python
# Pseudo-code for boundary checking
def check_boundaries(implementation, prd, sd):
    violations = []
    
    # Check for out-of-scope features
    for feature in implementation.features:
        if feature not in prd.requirements:
            violations.append(f"Out of scope: {feature}")
    
    # Check for unauthorized technologies
    for tech in implementation.technologies:
        if tech not in prd.approved_stack:
            violations.append(f"Unauthorized tech: {tech}")
    
    # Check for changed architecture
    if implementation.architecture != prd.architecture:
        violations.append("Architecture deviation detected")
    
    return violations
```

### Context Window Monitoring

```yaml
context_monitor:
  check_frequency: every_10_messages
  warning_threshold: 8000_tokens
  critical_threshold: 9500_tokens
  
  actions_on_warning:
