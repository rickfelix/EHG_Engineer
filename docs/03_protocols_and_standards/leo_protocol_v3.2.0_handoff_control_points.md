# LEO Protocol v3.2.0 - Handoff Control Points System

**Status**: Proposed Enhancement
**Date**: 2025-08-30
**Based On**: User Feedback & SD-002 Retrospective

---

## Executive Summary

Transform agent handoffs from simple transitions into **mandatory control points** with completion checklists that cannot be bypassed without explicit human exception. Each receiving agent knows exactly how they will be measured based on the checklist provided.

---

## Core Principles

1. **No Handoff Without Checklist Completion** - Agents cannot proceed without completing ALL items
2. **Explicit Success Criteria** - Receiving agent knows exactly what constitutes success
3. **Human Exception Only** - Only humans can grant exceptions to bypass checklist items
4. **Accountability Chain** - Each handoff creates an audit trail of completions and exceptions
5. **Measurable Outcomes** - Every checklist item must be verifiable

## Handoff Control Point Structure

```yaml
handoff_control_point:
  from_agent: LEAD|PLAN|EXEC
  to_agent: LEAD|PLAN|EXEC

## Exception Handling Process

### When Exceptions Are Needed

```markdown
## Exception Request Protocol

### 1. Agent Identifies Blocker
- Cannot complete mandatory checklist item
- Attempts resolution (15-minute timebox)
- Documents attempts made

### 2. Exception Request Created
```yaml
exception_request:
  handoff_id: <current handoff>
  item_blocked: <checklist item ID>
  
  classification:
    severity: critical|high|medium|low
    type: technical|process|external|resource
    
  details:
    what_failed: <specific failure>
    why_failed: <root cause>
    attempts_made:
      - attempt_1: <what/result>
      - attempt_2: <what/result>
      
  impact_analysis:
    if_proceed_without: <risks/impacts>
    if_wait_to_fix: <timeline impact>
    
  proposed_mitigation:
    workaround: <how to proceed>
    follow_up: <what to do later>
    risk_acceptance: <what risks remain>
    
  requested_by: <agent>
  timestamp: <when>
```

### 3. Human Review Required
- Notification sent to human
- Human reviews request
- Decision: Approve/Deny/Modify

### 4. Exception Decision
```yaml
exception_decision:
  request_id: <exception request ID>
  decision: approved|denied|conditional
  decided_by: <human username>
  
  conditions: # if conditional
    - condition_1
    - condition_2
    
  rationale: <why this decision>
  
  follow_up_required:
    action: <what must be done>
    owner: <who will do it>
    due_date: <when>
```

### 5. Proceed with Exception
- Exception logged in handoff
- Proceed to next agent WITH exception noted
- Receiving agent aware of exception and conditions
```

## Control Point Enforcement

### Automated Enforcement Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# handoff-control-point.sh

validate_handoff() {
    local from_agent=$1
    local to_agent=$2
    local checklist_file=$3
    
    echo "üîí HANDOFF CONTROL POINT: $from_agent ‚Üí $to_agent"
    echo "================================================"
    
    # Check mandatory items
    local incomplete_items=0
    local exceptions_requested=0
    
    while IFS= read -r line; do
        if [[ $line == *"[ ]"* ]]; then
            echo "‚ùå Incomplete: $line"
            ((incomplete_items++))
        elif [[ $line == *"[EXCEPTION]"* ]]; then
            echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  Exception Requested: $line"
            ((exceptions_requested++))
        elif [[ $line == *"[x]"* ]]; then
            echo "‚úÖ Complete: $line"
        fi
    done < "$checklist_file"
    
    # Determine if handoff can proceed
    if [ $incomplete_items -eq 0 ]; then
        echo ""
        echo "‚úÖ ALL MANDATORY ITEMS COMPLETE"
        echo "üöÄ Handoff approved to proceed"
        return 0
    elif [ $exceptions_requested -gt 0 ]; then
        echo ""
        echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  EXCEPTIONS REQUESTED: $exceptions_requested"
        echo "‚è∏Ô∏è  Awaiting human approval..."
        
        # Wait for human input
        read -p "Human: Approve exceptions? (yes/no): " approval
        if [ "$approval" = "yes" ]; then
            echo "‚úÖ Exceptions approved by human"
            echo "üöÄ Handoff approved to proceed WITH EXCEPTIONS"
            return 0
        else
            echo "‚ùå Exceptions denied"
            echo "üîÑ Return to $from_agent to complete items"
            return 1
        fi
    else
        echo ""
        echo "‚ùå INCOMPLETE ITEMS: $incomplete_items"
        echo "üîÑ Cannot proceed. Return to $from_agent"
        return 1
    fi
}

# Example usage

## Metrics and Reporting

### Handoff Performance Metrics

```yaml
handoff_metrics:
  total_handoffs: <count>
  
  successful_handoffs:
    first_attempt: <count>
    with_iterations: <count>
    
  exceptions:
    total_requested: <count>
    approved: <count>
    denied: <count>
    
  average_checklist_completion: <percentage>
  
  common_blockers:
    - blocker: CI/CD failures
      frequency: <count>
    - blocker: Linting errors
      frequency: <count>
      
  time_metrics:
    average_handoff_time: <minutes>
    fastest_handoff: <minutes>
    slowest_handoff: <minutes>
    
  quality_metrics:
    rework_rate: <percentage>
    defect_escape_rate: <percentage>
```

---

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Immediate (v3.2.0)
1. Implement mandatory checklists
2. Add control point validation
3. Create exception request process

### Phase 2: Next Sprint (v3.2.1)
1. Automate checklist validation
2. Add metrics collection
3. Create dashboard for handoff status

### Phase 3: Future (v3.3.0)
1. ML-based exception prediction
2. Automated exception approval for low-risk items
3. Predictive blocker identification

---

## Benefits

1. **Quality Assurance**: Nothing slips through the cracks
2. **Clear Accountability**: Each agent knows their success criteria
3. **Reduced Rework**: Problems caught at handoff, not later
4. **Audit Trail**: Complete record of decisions and exceptions
5. **Continuous Improvement**: Metrics identify systemic issues

---

## Conclusion

By transforming handoffs into control points with mandatory checklists, the LEO Protocol becomes a true quality assurance system rather than just a workflow guide. Agents cannot "skip steps" without explicit human approval, ensuring consistent quality and complete deliverables.

**The key insight**: Handoffs are not just transitions - they are quality gates that ensure excellence.
