# LEO Protocol v3.1.6 - Proposed Improvements

**Based on**: SD-002 Implementation Retrospective
**Date**: 2025-08-30
**Status**: Proposed

---

## Overview

These improvements address critical gaps discovered during the SD-002 shimmer effect implementation, focusing on making the LEO Protocol more resilient to real-world development challenges.

---

## 1. Pre-Implementation Health Assessment (NEW)

### Stage 0: Environment Health Check
**Owner**: EXEC Agent
**When**: Before starting any implementation
**Time**: 5-10 minutes

```markdown
### Required Health Checks:
1. **CI/CD Status**
   - Run: `gh run list --repo [owner/repo] --limit 5`
   - Document any pre-existing failures
   - If pipeline is red, document why

2. **Linting Status**
   - Run: `npm run lint 2>&1 | tail -5`
   - Document error count
   - If errors > 100, flag for LEAD review

3. **Test Suite Status**
   - Run: `npm test 2>&1 | tail -5`
   - Document passing/failing ratio
   - Flag any critical test failures

4. **Technical Debt Assessment**
   - Check for TODO comments in affected files
   - Review recent issue reports
   - Document known problems in area of work

### Health Check Report Template:
```yaml
environment_health:
  ci_cd_status: passing|failing|flaky
  linting_errors: <number>
  test_coverage: <percentage>
  known_issues: 
    - issue_1
    - issue_2
  risk_level: low|medium|high
  recommendation: proceed|proceed_with_caution|escalate
```
```

## 3. Blocker Escalation Framework

### Types of Blockers and Responses

```markdown
### Blocker Classification:
1. **Technical Debt Blockers**
   - Pre-existing linting/type errors
   - Failing tests unrelated to changes
   - Build configuration issues
   
   Response: 
   - If < 30 min to fix: Fix and document
   - If > 30 min: Create tech debt ticket and workaround

2. **Infrastructure Blockers**
   - CI/CD pipeline issues
   - Deployment environment problems
   - Third-party service outages
   
   Response:
   - Document and escalate to LEAD
   - Implement temporary workaround if possible
   - Update timeline expectations

3. **Dependency Blockers**
   - Missing packages
   - Version conflicts
   - Breaking changes in dependencies
   
   Response:
   - Attempt resolution (15 min timebox)
   - If unresolved, escalate with specific error details
   - Consider alternative approaches

### Escalation Template:
```yaml
blocker_report:
  type: technical_debt|infrastructure|dependency|other
  description: <detailed description>
  impact: blocks_progress|degrades_quality|delays_timeline
  attempted_solutions:
    - solution_1: <result>
    - solution_2: <result>
  recommended_action: fix_now|workaround|defer|escalate
  estimated_effort: <hours>
```
```

## 4. Iterative Feedback Loops

### Feedback Checkpoints

```markdown
### Mandatory Feedback Points:
1. **Post-Implementation Review**
   - Self-review code changes
   - Run local quality checks
   - Verify against PRD

2. **Pre-Push Verification**
   - Lint check must pass
   - Tests must pass
   - CI/CD pre-check

3. **Post-Push Monitoring**
   - Watch CI/CD execution
   - Check for automated comments
   - Monitor for 5 minutes post-push

4. **User Acceptance (for UI)**
   - Demo to user or capture video
   - Gather feedback
   - Iterate if needed (without considering it failure)

### Feedback Response Protocol:
- Negative feedback = opportunity for improvement
- Document feedback in handoff notes
- Allow for 2-3 iteration cycles before escalation
- Track common feedback patterns for protocol improvement
```

## 5. Quality Gates Implementation

### Automated Quality Gates

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# pre-implementation-check.sh

echo "üîç Running Pre-Implementation Health Check..."

# Check CI/CD status
CI_STATUS=$(gh run list --limit 1 --json status -q '.[0].status')
if [ "$CI_STATUS" != "completed" ] || [ "$CI_STATUS" != "success" ]; then
    echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  WARNING: CI/CD pipeline is not green"
fi

# Check linting
LINT_ERRORS=$(npm run lint 2>&1 | grep -c "error")
if [ $LINT_ERRORS -gt 100 ]; then
    echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  WARNING: High number of linting errors: $LINT_ERRORS"
    echo "   Consider cleaning up technical debt first"
fi

# Check tests
TEST_RESULT=$(npm test 2>&1 | grep -c "failing")
if [ $TEST_RESULT -gt 0 ]; then
    echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  WARNING: Tests are failing"
fi

echo "‚úÖ Health check complete. See warnings above."
```

## 6. Technical Debt Registry

### Technical Debt Tracking

```markdown
### Technical Debt Log Format:
```yaml
technical_debt:
  - id: TD-001
    found_date: 2025-08-30
    found_by: EXEC-SD-002
    type: linting_errors
    severity: high
    count: 1582
    location: entire_codebase
    impact: blocks_ci_cd
    workaround: fixed_during_implementation
    cleanup_effort: 3_hours
    status: partially_resolved
    
  - id: TD-002
    found_date: 2025-08-30
    found_by: EXEC-SD-002  
    type: type_safety
    severity: medium
    count: 1491
    location: multiple_files
    impact: reduces_code_quality
    workaround: replaced_any_with_unknown
    cleanup_effort: 2_hours
    status: resolved
```

### Registry Location:
`/docs/technical-debt/registry.yaml`

### Review Cadence:
- Weekly review by LEAD agent
- Prioritization based on impact
- Allocation of 20% capacity for debt reduction
```

## 7. Visual Verification Protocol

### For All UI Changes

```typescript
// visual-verification.spec.ts template
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test.describe('Feature: <FEATURE_NAME>', () => {
  test('captures visual evidence', async ({ page }) => {
    // Navigate to feature
    await page.goto('http://localhost:PORT/path');
    
    // Capture before state (if applicable)
    await page.screenshot({ 
      path: 'evidence/before.png',
      fullPage: true 
    });
    
    // Interact with feature
    // ... interactions ...
    
    // Capture after state
    await page.screenshot({ 
      path: 'evidence/after.png',
      fullPage: true 
    });
    
    // Verify key visual elements
    const element = page.locator('.feature-selector');
    await expect(element).toBeVisible();
    
    // Generate evidence report
    const evidence = {
      feature: '<FEATURE_NAME>',
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
      screenshots: ['before.png', 'after.png'],
      verified: true
    };
    
    // Save evidence
    require('fs').writeFileSync(
      'evidence/report.json',
      JSON.stringify(evidence, null, 2)
    );
  });
});
```

## 8. Continuous Improvement Loop

### Protocol Evolution Process

```markdown
### After Each Strategic Directive:
1. **Retrospective** (Required)
   - What went well?
   - What could improve?
   - What was missing from protocol?

2. **Protocol Updates**
   - Document proposed changes
   - Review with team
   - Version increment

3. **Metrics Tracking**
   - Time to completion vs estimate
   - Number of commits required
   - Protocol deviations
   - Blocker frequency

### Success Metrics:
- Reduction in protocol deviations over time
- Decrease in average time to completion
- Increase in first-time success rate
- Reduction in post-handoff iterations
```

## Implementation Priority

1. **Immediate** (v3.1.6):
   - Pre-Implementation Health Assessment
   - Enhanced Definition of Done
   - CI/CD verification requirement

2. **Next Sprint** (v3.1.7):
   - Blocker Escalation Framework
   - Technical Debt Registry
   - Automated Quality Gates

3. **Future** (v3.2.0):
   - Full Visual Verification Protocol

## Conclusion

These improvements transform the LEO Protocol from a rigid, linear process to an adaptive, resilient framework that acknowledges and handles real-world development challenges. The focus shifts from perfect execution to continuous improvement and learning.

**Key Philosophy Change**: 
From "Follow the protocol perfectly" to "Use the protocol as a guide while adapting to reality"
