## Handoff Control System

### Mandatory Checkpoints
```markdown
HANDOFF BLOCKED if checklist incomplete
↓
REQUEST EXCEPTION
↓
HUMAN APPROVAL REQUIRED
↓
PROCEED only with approval
```

### Exception Process
```yaml
exception_request:
  blocker: [specific items]
  reason: [justification]
  impact: [consequences]
  solution: [alternative]
  
human_review:
  approve: [yes/no]
  conditions: [if any]
```

### Handoff Automation
```bash
# Perform handoff with validation
node scripts/handoff-controller.js handoff LEAD-to-PLAN

# Check handoff status
node scripts/handoff-controller.js status

# Archive completed work
node scripts/handoff-controller.js archive EXEC implementation-complete
```

---

## Context Management System

### Monitoring Commands
```bash
# Check current usage
node scripts/context-monitor.js check

# Continuous monitoring
node scripts/context-monitor.js monitor 60

# Generate handoff summary
node scripts/context-monitor.js handoff LEAD
```

### Context Thresholds
- **70% Warning**: Run /compact
- **90% Critical**: Immediate action required
- **100% Overflow**: Emergency recovery

### Optimization Strategies
1. **Summarization**: Long content → bullet points
2. **Externalization**: Code → file references
3. **Deduplication**: Remove repetition
4. **Prioritization**: Keep only active items

### Emergency Recovery
```markdown
1. Run: /compact focus: "critical task"
2. Archive completed work to files
3. Create checkpoint with state
4. If still over: /clear and reload
```

## CLAUDE.md Integration

### File Hierarchy
```
1. .claude/CLAUDE.local.md    (highest priority)
2. ./CLAUDE.md                 (project root)
3. ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md         (global)
4. templates/claude-md/        (agent-specific)
```

### Essential Commands
- `/context` - Check token usage
- `/compact` - Summarize conversation
- `/clear` - Reset (use carefully)
- `/init` - Generate CLAUDE.md
- `/cost` - Track consumption

### Agent Templates
```bash
templates/claude-md/
├── CLAUDE.md              # Master configuration
├── agents/
│   ├── CLAUDE-LEAD.md     # LEAD agent context
│   ├── CLAUDE-PLAN.md     # PLAN agent context
│   └── CLAUDE-EXEC.md     # EXEC agent context
└── sub-agents/
    ├── CLAUDE-DESIGN.md   # Design specialist
    ├── CLAUDE-SECURITY.md # Security specialist
    └── ...                # Other specialists
```

## Implementation Workflow

### Complete SD Lifecycle
```markdown
1. LEAD AGENT
   - Create Strategic Directive
   - Define success criteria
   - Complete checklist
   - Handoff to PLAN

2. PLAN AGENT
   - Create PRD from SD
   - Define technical approach
   - Complete checklist
   - Handoff to EXEC

3. EXEC AGENT
   - Check boundaries
   - Activate sub-agents
   - Implement PRD exactly
   - Complete checklist
   - Deploy

4. VERIFICATION
   - All checklists complete
   - Tests passing
   - CI/CD green
   - Documentation updated
```

### Quality Gates
Each handoff must pass:
1. Checklist validation (9/9 items)
2. Context check (<threshold)
3. Boundary compliance
4. Summary generation
5. Archive completion
