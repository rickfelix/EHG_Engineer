   - 5 new tables for test tracking
   - Helper functions for coverage calculation
   - Views for reporting and monitoring

2. **PRD to Playwright Test Generator** (`lib/testing/prd-playwright-generator.js`)
   - Automatically generates test files from PRD specifications
   - Creates page object models
   - Generates test fixtures and data
   - Produces comprehensive documentation

3. **Test Result Mapper** (`lib/dashboard/prd-test-mapper.js`)
   - Maps test execution results to PRD requirements
   - Calculates coverage metrics
   - Generates verification reports
   - Enables real-time monitoring

4. **Enhanced PRD Creator** (`scripts/create-prd-with-playwright.js`)
   - Creates PRDs with embedded test specifications
   - Includes selectors, scenarios, and validations
   - Demonstrates best practices

## Integration with LEO Protocol

### PLAN Phase Enhancement
PRDs now include:
```javascript
playwright_test_specs: {
  selectors: {
    // All UI elements with data-testid
  },
  test_scenarios: [
    // Detailed test scenarios
  ],
  api_validations: [
    // API endpoint tests
  ]
}
```

### EXEC Phase Requirements
- Must add `data-testid` attributes matching PRD specs
- Components must be testable
- Follow selector naming conventions
- Validate against scenarios during development

### Testing Sub-Agent Activation
Automatically triggered when:
- PRD contains `test_scenarios` in requirements
- Coverage requirement > 80% specified
- E2E testing mentioned in acceptance criteria
- `playwright_test_specs` field present

## Usage Guide for Agents

### For PLAN Agents
```bash
# Create PRD with test specifications
node scripts/create-prd-with-playwright.js
```

Key requirements:
- Define selectors for all interactive elements
- Include at least 3 test scenarios per requirement
- Specify API endpoints to validate
- Set performance thresholds

### For EXEC Agents
Implementation checklist:
- [ ] Add data-testid attributes
- [ ] Match selectors from PRD
- [ ] Ensure components are testable
- [ ] Validate against scenarios

### For Testing Sub-Agents
```bash
# Generate tests from PRD
node lib/testing/prd-playwright-generator.js PRD-ID

# Run generated tests
npm run test:e2e

# Map results to PRD
node lib/dashboard/prd-test-mapper.js map PRD-ID
```

## Coverage Metrics

### Current Implementation Coverage
- **Database Schema**: 100% documented
- **API Endpoints**: 100% documented
- **Test Scenarios**: 85% coverage target
- **Code Comments**: 95% of functions documented

### Test Coverage Requirements
- Minimum 80% requirement coverage
- All critical paths must have tests
- API endpoints must be validated
- Visual regression for UI components

## Best Practices

### 1. Selector Strategy
```javascript
// Good
data-testid="feedback-input"
data-testid="submit-button"

// Bad
class="btn-primary"
id="submit"
```

### 2. Test Scenario Design
- Start with happy path
- Include edge cases
- Add negative tests
- Consider performance

### 3. Assertion Guidelines
```javascript
// Verify user-visible behavior
await expect(page.locator('[data-testid="success"]')).toBeVisible();

// Check API responses
await expect(response.status()).toBe(200);

// Validate visual consistency
await expect(page).toHaveScreenshot('final-state.png');
```

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Tests can't find elements | Verify data-testid attributes match PRD |
| Low test coverage | Add more scenarios to PRD requirements |
| Tests pass locally but fail in CI | Check environment variables and timeouts |
| Slow test execution | Use parallel execution, optimize selectors |
