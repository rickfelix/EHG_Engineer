# Professional PRD Creation Process

## Overview
This document defines the improved PRD (Product Requirements Document) creation process for LEO Protocol, ensuring every PRD meets professional standards and guides successful implementation.

## Lessons Learned: SDIP Case Study

### The Problem
The SDIP Strategic Directive had a comprehensive PRD script (`create-sdip-prd.js`) containing:
- ✅ 8 detailed functional requirements
- ✅ Complete technical specifications  
- ✅ 5 API endpoints defined
- ✅ Performance requirements
- ✅ Risk assessments
- ✅ Sub-agent triggers

**But this script was never executed!** The database contained only a minimal placeholder PRD with empty fields.

### Root Cause
**Process Gap**: The comprehensive PRD creation script existed but was not integrated into the standard workflow, leading to incomplete PRDs reaching implementation.

## Improved PRD Creation Process

### Phase 1: PLAN Agent Responsibilities

#### 1. Create Comprehensive PRD Script
Every Strategic Directive must have a dedicated PRD creation script following this template:

```javascript
// File: scripts/create-{directive-name}-prd.js
const prdData = {
  // Required Core Fields
  id: `PRD-${Date.now()}`,
  title: '[Descriptive Title] - [Component/Feature Name]',
  directive_id: 'SD-YYYY-MMDD-XXX',
  
  // Executive Context (MANDATORY)
  executive_summary: '[150+ character summary]',
  business_context: '[Business problem and opportunity]',
  technical_context: '[Technical requirements and integration]',
  
  // Detailed Requirements (MANDATORY)
  functional_requirements: [
    {
      id: 'REQ-001',
      name: '[Requirement Name]',
      description: '[Detailed description]',
      acceptance_criteria: ['Criteria 1', 'Criteria 2', ...]
    },
    // Minimum 5 requirements
  ],
  
  non_functional_requirements: [
    {
      agent: '[Sub-Agent Name]',
      reason: '[Why this sub-agent is needed]',
      tasks: ['Task 1', 'Task 2', ...]
    },
    // Minimum 3 NFRs
  ],
  
  // Technical Specifications (MANDATORY)
  technical_requirements: {
    architecture: { /* Architecture details */ },
    components: [
      {
        name: '[Component Name]',
        description: '[Component purpose]',
        requirements: ['Req 1', 'Req 2', ...]
      },
      // Minimum 3 components
    ],
    apis: [
      {
        endpoint: '/api/path',
        methods: ['GET', 'POST'],
        description: '[API purpose]'
      },
      // Define all endpoints
    ]
  },
  
  // Quality Assurance (MANDATORY)
  performance_requirements: {
    response_times: { /* Performance specs */ },
    throughput: { /* Load specs */ },
    reliability: { /* Uptime specs */ }
  },
  
  acceptance_criteria: [
    '[Acceptance criterion 1]',
    '[Acceptance criterion 2]',
    // Minimum 5 criteria
  ],
  
  risks: [
    {
      risk: '[Risk description]',
      mitigation: '[Mitigation strategy]',
      severity: 'low|medium|high'
    },
    // Minimum 3 risks
  ]
};
```

#### 2. Execute PRD Creation Script
**MANDATORY**: Every PRD creation script MUST be executed during the PLAN phase:

```bash
# Execute during PLAN phase
node scripts/create-{directive-name}-prd.js

# Validate immediately after creation
node scripts/prd-validation-checklist.js {PRD-ID}
```

#### 3. Validate PRD Quality
Use the automated validation checklist:

```bash
node scripts/prd-validation-checklist.js PRD-XXXXXXXXX
```

**Quality Thresholds:**
- **Excellent**: 95%+ (Production ready)
- **Good**: 80%+ (Minor improvements needed)
- **Acceptable**: 65%+ (Minimum for implementation)
- **Needs Work**: <65% (Must improve before EXEC handoff)

## PRD Validation Checklist

### Critical Fields (Must Pass)
- [ ] **Title**: Descriptive and specific
- [ ] **Executive Summary**: 150+ characters
- [ ] **Business Context**: Problem and opportunity defined
- [ ] **Technical Context**: Integration requirements clear
- [ ] **Functional Requirements**: 5+ detailed requirements
- [ ] **Non-Functional Requirements**: 3+ with sub-agent triggers
- [ ] **Technical Requirements**: Comprehensive specifications
- [ ] **Acceptance Criteria**: 5+ measurable criteria
- [ ] **Performance Requirements**: Defined metrics
- [ ] **Risks**: 3+ risks with mitigation strategies

### Quality Indicators
- [ ] **Strategic Alignment**: Linked to Strategic Directive
- [ ] **Risk Assessment**: Comprehensive risk analysis
- [ ] **Performance Defined**: Clear performance metrics
- [ ] **Timeline Realistic**: Effort estimation provided

### Sub-Agent Activation Triggers
- [ ] **Database**: Required if schema changes detected
- [ ] **Design**: Required if 2+ UI components
- [ ] **Security**: Required if security mentioned
- [ ] **Testing**: Required if coverage >80% or E2E testing

## Mandatory Process Steps

### For PLAN Agents
1. **Create PRD Script**: Write comprehensive PRD creation script
2. **Execute Script**: Run script to populate database
3. **Validate Quality**: Run validation checklist (must score 65%+)
4. **Fix Issues**: Address any validation failures
5. **Document Handoff**: Include PRD validation results in PLAN-to-EXEC handoff

### For LEAD Agents (Approval Phase)
1. **Review PRD**: Check PRD completeness in database
2. **Validate Against SD**: Ensure alignment with Strategic Directive
3. **Approve/Reject**: Based on PRD quality and implementation results

### Quality Gates
- **PLAN Phase**: PRD must score 65%+ to proceed to EXEC
- **EXEC Phase**: Implementation must align with PRD specifications
- **VERIFICATION Phase**: PRD acceptance criteria must be met
- **APPROVAL Phase**: Final validation against PRD success criteria

## Tools and Scripts

### PRD Creation
- `scripts/create-{name}-prd.js` - Comprehensive PRD creation
- `scripts/prd-validation-checklist.js` - Quality validation

### PRD Management  
- `scripts/leo-prd-validator.js` - File-based PRD validation
- `scripts/update-prd-status.js` - Update PRD progress
- `scripts/complete-prd-validation.js` - Mark PRD as complete

## Success Metrics

### PRD Quality Indicators
- 95%+ PRDs score "Good" or "Excellent" on validation
- Zero incomplete PRDs reach implementation
- 90%+ implementation-to-PRD alignment

### Process Efficiency
- PRD creation time: <2 hours with AI agents
- Validation time: <10 minutes automated
- Rework rate: <10% of PRDs need major revisions

## Emergency Protocol

### If Incomplete PRD Detected
1. **Stop Implementation**: Halt EXEC phase work immediately
2. **Create Comprehensive PRD**: Use existing script template
3. **Execute and Validate**: Run through full validation process
4. **Update Database**: Replace incomplete PRD with comprehensive version
5. **Resume Implementation**: Continue with proper PRD guidance

### Recovery Commands
```bash
# Fix incomplete PRD
node scripts/create-{name}-prd.js
node scripts/prd-validation-checklist.js {PRD-ID}

# Replace incomplete PRD in database
# (Use scripts/fix-sdip-completion.js as template)
```

## Implementation Notes

- **Database Schema**: Supports all required PRD fields
- **Real-time Sync**: Dashboard automatically reflects PRD updates
- **Version Control**: PRDs are versioned and tracked
- **Integration**: PRDs link to Strategic Directives and handoff documents

This process prevents the SDIP issue from recurring and ensures all PRDs meet professional standards before implementation begins.
