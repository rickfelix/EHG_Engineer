# Stage 12 "Sales Logic" -- OpenAI Response (GPT 5.3)

### 1) Gap Assessment Table

| Gap | GUI Has | CLI Has | Importance (1-5) | Downstream Impact | Verdict | Challenge |
|---|---|---|---:|---|---|---|
| Sales model explicitness | No explicit model enum | 6-value `sales_model` enum | 2 | Better consistency into Stage 13+ | **CLI better** | Not a gap; keep enum as mandatory |
| Pipeline structure richness | Default pipeline with actions/time/conversion | `deal_stages[]` with duration + descriptions | 3 | Stage 13 roadmap and ops planning less concrete | Add optional `entry_criteria/exit_criteria/key_actions` to deal stages | Avoid overfitting to one sales motion too early |
| Funnel measurement | Conversion per pipeline stage | Separate `funnel_stages[]` with metric + target | 4 | Forecasting quality and diagnosis suffer without conversion semantics | Keep separation, add optional conversion metadata in funnel stages | Don’t duplicate with Stage 11 funnel assumptions blindly |
| Success metrics governance | Metric + frequency + owner | None explicit beyond funnel targets | 4 | No accountability loop before BLUEPRINT | Add `success_metrics[]` with owner/frequency | Could be done in Stage 13 ops design, but weak for Reality Gate |
| Unit economics visibility in sales stage | Explicit deal size/LTV/CAC fields | Only indirect via targets | 3 | Harder to validate GTM-sales coherence | Add lightweight `sales_kpis_snapshot` (references Stage 5/7/11) | Avoid recomputing financial model in Stage 12 |
| Journey operational detail | Milestone + trigger + success criteria | `customer_journey[]` mapped to funnel stage + touchpoint | 4 | Weak handoff to product and automation design | Extend journey step with `trigger`, `success_criteria`, `owner` | Keep minimum required fields small |
| Reality Gate depth | None | Structural completeness checks only | 5 | Weak phase transition quality; Stage 13 starts on shaky assumptions | Enhance gate with coherence checks, not just counts | Don’t make gate so strict that valid early ventures get blocked |
| Stage 11 consumption | Implicit in GUI | Not explicit in schema logic | 5 | Sales logic may drift from GTM/persona/channel reality | Add explicit mappings from channels/personas to stages/journey | Keep mappings generated by `analysisStep`, not manual burden |

### 2) AnalysisStep Design (inputs, prior stage mapping, outputs)

**Inputs (from stages):**
- **Stage 4/5/7:** competitive intensity, pricing model, unit economics envelope.
- **Stage 10:** brand decision, narrative constraints, positioning.
- **Stage 11:** tiers/personas/pain points, channel mix, target CAC, funnel assumptions, coherence warnings.
- **Current Stage 12 draft:** user edits/overrides.

**`analysisStep` should produce:**
- `recommended_sales_model` + confidence + rationale.
- `deal_stages[]` (pipeline progression, criteria, duration, actions).
- `funnel_stages[]` (metric definitions, targets, optional conversion baselines).
- `channel_to_stage_mapping[]` (which channels feed which funnel/deal entry points).
- `persona_pathways[]` (tier/persona-specific progression differences).
- `customer_journey[]` enriched with trigger/success criteria.
- `success_metrics[]` (owner + frequency).
- `sales_kpis_snapshot` (deal size, CAC, LTV:CAC target band, sales cycle target).
- `reality_gate_assessment` (pass/fail + failed checks + remediation list).

---

### 3) Sales Model Selection Logic

Use a rule+score model:

- **Self-serve** if low ACV, short cycle, high organic/product-led channel weight.
- **Inside-sales** if medium ACV, moderate complexity, demo-led but not enterprise procurement-heavy.
- **Enterprise** if high ACV, long cycle, multiple stakeholders, security/compliance buying steps.
- **Hybrid** when channel/persona mix materially splits motions.
- **Marketplace** when supply-demand/liquidity mechanics dominate acquisition and conversion.
- **Channel** when partner-led distribution is primary route to pipeline.

Primary drivers from prior stages:
- Stage 11 channel types + CAC pattern,
- Stage 5 unit economics (payback tolerance),
- Stage 7 pricing structure,
- Stage 10 brand/positioning (premium vs volume motion).

---

### 4) Deal Stages vs Funnel Stages Decision

**Keep CLI separation** (deal vs funnel).  
It is analytically cleaner and better for downstream systems:

- Deal stages = workflow/progression for opportunities.
- Funnel stages = measurement points for conversion/leakage.

GUI-style merge is simpler UX, but conflates operations and analytics.

---

### 5) Conversion Rates Decision

**Add conversion rates, but to funnel stages (not deal stages) by default.**

- Add optional fields: `from_stage`, `to_stage`, `baseline_conversion`, `target_conversion`.
- Allow `deal_stages` conversion only as derived/reporting if needed.
- This preserves clean separation and avoids duplicate truth sources.

---

### 6) Sales Metrics Decision

At Stage 12, include **lightweight explicit KPI snapshot**, not full financial recomputation:

- `avg_deal_size_target`
- `sales_cycle_days_target` (already present, keep)
- `target_cac_reference` (from Stage 11)
- `ltv_cac_target_band` (from Stage 5/7/11 coherence)

This improves Reality Gate quality without redoing Stage 5.

---

### 7) Customer Journey Design

Best model: **CLI mapping + GUI milestone rigor**.

Keep existing:
- `step`, `funnel_stage`, `touchpoint`

Add:
- `trigger_action`
- `success_criteria`
- `owner` (role/team)

This gives traceability + operability with minimal schema expansion.

---

### 8) Reality Gate Enhancement

Current gate checks counts only. Expand to **completeness + coherence**:

- Structural checks (existing counts)  
- Coherence checks:
  - sales model matches channel mix/persona complexity
  - cycle length and deal size align with pricing + CAC assumptions
  - journey covers critical funnel transitions
  - at least one named owner/frequency for key metrics
- Output explicit remediation items when failed.

---

### 9) CLI Superiorities (preserve these)

- Explicit `sales_model` enum (forces strategic choice).
- Separation of pipeline and metrics (clean architecture).
- Journey-to-funnel traceability.
- Exported pure Reality Gate function (testability and reuse).
- Stage template structure aligns with Stage 2-11 `analysisStep` pattern.

---

### 10) Recommended Stage 12 Schema

Keep current core fields and add:

- `deal_stages[].entry_criteria` (optional)
- `deal_stages[].exit_criteria` (optional)
- `deal_stages[].key_actions[]` (optional)
- `funnel_stages[].baseline_conversion` (optional)
- `funnel_stages[].target_conversion` (optional)
- `customer_journey[].trigger_action` (optional)
- `customer_journey[].success_criteria` (optional)
- `customer_journey[].owner` (optional)
- `success_metrics[]` (name, target, frequency, owner)
- `sales_kpis_snapshot` (avg_deal_size_target, target_cac_reference, ltv_cac_target_band)

---

### 11) Minimum Viable Change (priority-ordered)

1. Add Stage 12 `analysisStep` to auto-generate model/pipeline/funnel/journey from Stages 1-11.
2. Enhance Reality Gate with coherence checks.
3. Add `success_metrics[]` (owner + frequency).
4. Add optional conversion fields in `funnel_stages`.
5. Add journey trigger/success criteria.
6. Add KPI snapshot object (references, not recomputation).

---

### 12) Cross-Stage Impact

- **Stage 13+ improves**: roadmap and blueprint decisions get a credible go-to-market execution model.
- **No hard upstream schema changes required** if Stage 12 consumes existing Stage 10/11 outputs.
- **Validation quality improves** at phase transition by testing strategic coherence, not just field presence.

---

### 13) Dependency Conflicts (with Stages 1-11 decisions)

No direct conflicts with settled decisions.  
Potential soft dependency to watch:

- Stage 11 must reliably expose channel typing + persona pain points in machine-readable form for Stage 12 selection logic.
- If Stage 11 coherence warnings are not structured, Stage 12 gate checks may be brittle.

So: mostly **consumption contract tightening**, not prior-stage redesign.

---

### 14) Contrarian Take

Most obvious recommendation is to add lots of operational detail now.  
**Counterpoint:** Stage 12 may be getting over-engineered for ventures still pre-scale.

Risk if overbuilt:
- False precision on conversion/owners before real market signal.
- Heavy schema burdens user input and slows iteration.
- Duplicates Stage 5/11 logic in a new place.

Lean alternative:
- Keep Stage 12 minimal + generated defaults.
- Require only coherence-critical fields.
- Push deep operational instrumentation to Stage 13 execution planning.
