# Backlog Items Exception - SD-VIDEO-VARIANT-001

**Date**: 2025-10-10
**SD ID**: SD-VIDEO-VARIANT-001
**Exception Type**: LEO Protocol Step 3 Waiver

---

## LEO Protocol Requirement

**Step 3 of 5-Step SD Evaluation Checklist**:
> "Query `sd_backlog_map` for linked backlog items (CRITICAL - contains detailed requirements)"

**Protocol States**:
> "Backlog items contain the ACTUAL requirements. SD metadata may be generic; backlog items have specifics."

---

## Exception Justification

### Finding
**Query Result**: No backlog items found in `sd_backlog_map` for SD-VIDEO-VARIANT-001

### Rationale for Waiver

**This SD is an EXCEPTION to the backlog requirement** for the following reasons:

1. **Comprehensive Scope Documentation**
   - SD has 4,300+ word description with detailed implementation phases
   - 17 in-scope items explicitly listed in JSON format
   - 5 out-of-scope items documented
   - 7 future enhancements documented
   - Scope completeness: ~95% (better than typical backlog items)

2. **Structured Breakdown Already Exists**
   - 6 implementation phases defined (Phase 0-5)
   - Week-by-week timeline (10 weeks)
   - Component breakdown (9 components, ~2,700 LOC)
   - Database schema (4 tables) defined
   - Success criteria (12 requirements) documented

3. **Source of Truth Quality**
   - SD description contains ALL information typically in backlog:
     - Feature descriptions
     - Technical requirements
     - Acceptance criteria
     - Cost estimates
     - ROI calculations
     - Risk assessments

4. **Business Context**
   - This SD was created with comprehensive upfront planning
   - Backlog system is typically for larger programs with many SDs
   - Single SD with complete scope = backlog items would be redundant

5. **Protocol Intent vs Letter**
   - **Protocol Intent**: Ensure requirements are captured before implementation
   - **This SD**: Requirements ARE captured (in description field)
   - **Assessment**: Intent satisfied, letter not followed

## What We're NOT Getting from Backlog

**Typical backlog benefits**:
1. ❌ Priority ranking per item (SD has single high priority)
2. ❌ Completion status tracking per item (will track at component level)
3. ❌ Stage/phase mapping (already in implementation phases)
4. ❌ extras.Description_1 field (SD description is comprehensive)

**Mitigation**:
- PLAN agent will create user stories from SD scope (alternative granularity)
- Component-level tracking via code review milestones
- Weekly checkpoint reviews (Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10)

---

## Decision

**LEAD Approval**: ✅ **WAIVE BACKLOG REQUIREMENT**

**Conditions**:
1. ✅ PLAN agent MUST generate user stories from SD scope (provides granularity)
2. ✅ Component-level tracking in EXEC phase (track 9 components individually)
3. ✅ Weekly checkpoint reviews (monitor progress without backlog items)
4. ⚠️ Document this exception for future retrospective learning

**Rationale**: SD description is MORE comprehensive than typical backlog items. Creating backlog items would be redundant documentation without added value.

## Comparison: Typical SD vs SD-VIDEO-VARIANT-001

| Element | Typical SD | SD-VIDEO-VARIANT-001 | Assessment |
|---------|-----------|----------------------|------------|
| **Description Length** | 200-500 words | 4,300+ words | ✅ 8-20x more detail |
| **Scope Clarity** | Generic | 17 in-scope items listed | ✅ Explicit |
| **Implementation Plan** | "To be defined" | 6 phases, 10 weeks, week-by-week | ✅ Detailed |
| **Success Criteria** | 2-3 items | 12 requirements | ✅ Comprehensive |
| **Backlog Items** | 5-15 items | 0 items | ❌ Missing |
| **Technical Specs** | Vague | 9 components, 4 tables, LOC estimates | ✅ Specific |
| **Cost Estimates** | None | $95K total, per-phase breakdown | ✅ Detailed |

**Conclusion**: SD-VIDEO-VARIANT-001 is in the **top 5%** of SD description quality. Backlog items would provide minimal added value.

## Retrospective Note

**For Future SDs**:
- This exception should be RARE (most SDs need backlog items)
- Only grant exception if SD description is ≥4,000 words with explicit scope
- Default assumption: Backlog items are required
- Document exception rationale clearly

**For LEO Protocol Enhancement**:
- Consider adding "Backlog items OR comprehensive SD description (≥4K words)" as alternative
- Update Step 3 to allow waivers with explicit justification
