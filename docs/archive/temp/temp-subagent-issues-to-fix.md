# Sub-Agent Assessment Review - Issues to Fix
## SD-VIDEO-VARIANT-001

**Date**: 2025-10-10
**Review Type**: Pre-Approval Issue Identification
**Reviewer**: LEAD Agent

---

## Overview

Reviewing all three sub-agent assessments to identify:
- ‚ùå Issues that BLOCK approval
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues that need fixing before PLAN phase
- ‚úÖ Recommendations to incorporate into scope
- üìã Scope adjustments required

---

## BLOCKING ISSUES (Must fix NOW)

### ‚ùå ISSUE #1: Missing Backlog Items

**Source**: LEAD 5-Step Checklist (Step 3)
**Finding**: No backlog items found for SD-VIDEO-VARIANT-001
**Protocol Requirement**: "Backlog items contain the ACTUAL requirements"

**Problem**:
```
Query Result: ‚ö†Ô∏è NO backlog items found for this SD
Status: This may indicate scope definition is incomplete
```

**Impact**: CRITICAL
- SD has description/scope in text form only
- No structured backlog items to map to PRD objectives
- No priority/completion tracking available
- Violates LEO Protocol requirement (Step 3 of 5-step checklist)

**Resolution Required**:
1. **Option A**: Create backlog items from SD description (17 in-scope items)
2. **Option B**: Proceed without backlog (document rationale for exception)
3. **Option C**: Mark as draft until backlog created

**LEAD Decision Needed**: Which option should we take?

---

### ‚ùå ISSUE #2: No PRD Exists

**Source**: LEAD 5-Step Checklist (Step 2)
**Finding**: No PRD exists for SD-VIDEO-VARIANT-001

**Problem**:
```
Query Result: ‚ùå NO PRD exists - PRD creation required (PLAN responsibility)
```

**Impact**: EXPECTED (not blocking for LEAD phase)
- PRD creation is PLAN agent responsibility
- This is correct workflow: LEAD‚ÜíPLAN‚ÜíPRD creation

**Resolution**: None needed - this is expected state

---

## SCOPE ADJUSTMENTS REQUIRED

### ‚ö†Ô∏è ADJUSTMENT #1: Add Database Schema Enhancement

**Source**: Database Architect (CRITICAL requirement)
**Current Scope**: Does NOT include use_case_templates lookup table
**Recommended Scope**: Add use_case_templates table

**Current SD Scope**:
```json
"in_scope": [
  "21 use case templates",  // ‚Üê Stored as data only
  "3 new database tables"   // ‚Üê Should be 4 tables
]
```

**Recommended Change**:
```json
"in_scope": [
  "21 use case templates (normalized lookup table)",
  "4 new database tables (variant_groups, video_variants, variant_performance, use_case_templates)"
]
```

**Rationale** (Database Architect):
- Improves data integrity
- Normalizes template storage
- Prevents VARCHAR template names (better FK relationships)

**Action**: Update SD scope to include 4 tables instead of 3

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è ADJUSTMENT #2: Clarify Component Sizing Target

**Source**: Systems Analyst + Design Sub-Agent (consensus)
**Current Scope**: No component sizing guidance
**Recommended Scope**: Add explicit component sizing constraints

**Current SD Success Criteria**:
```
- ‚úÖ TypeScript strict mode enabled (no any types)
```

**Recommended Addition**:
```
- ‚úÖ Component sizing: All components <600 LOC (enforce in code review)
- ‚úÖ Extract sub-components if any component exceeds 600 LOC
```

**Rationale**:
- Systems Analyst: "Component becomes unmaintainable if >800 lines"
- Design: "Keep all components <600 LOC"
- 2 components risk exceeding: VariantTestingWorkspace (600-800), PerformanceTrackingDashboard (600-800)

**Action**: Add component sizing requirement to success criteria

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è ADJUSTMENT #3: Formalize Week 4 Checkpoint

**Source**: LEAD Simplicity First Gate
**Current Scope**: 10-week single phase implementation
**Recommended Scope**: Add formal checkpoint at Week 4

**Current Implementation Phases**:
```
Phase 1: Database Foundation (Week 1-2)
Phase 2: Variant Generation (Week 3-4)
Phase 3: Performance Tracking (Week 5-6)
Phase 4: Winner Identification (Week 7-8)
Phase 5: Integration & Testing (Week 9-10)
```

**Recommended Addition**:
```
Week 4 Checkpoint (LEAD Review):
- Assess MVP progress (Phases 1-2 complete)
- Decide: Continue full scope OR defer Phases 3-5 to separate SD
- Option to mark Phase 1-2 as "MVP Complete", split remaining work
```

**Rationale**:
- LEAD 80/20 analysis: 60% value delivered by Week 4
- Natural breakpoint after variant generation
- Allows scope reduction if MVP proves sufficient

**Action**: Add Week 4 checkpoint to implementation timeline

---

## TECHNICAL DEBT TO ADDRESS

### üìã DEBT #1: Zero Test Coverage in Video Area

**Source**: Systems Analyst
**Current State**: VideoPromptStudio has 0% test coverage
**Required State**: 80%+ coverage for new code (per SD success criteria)

**Problem**:
```
Existing Debt in Video Area:
1. ‚ùå No automated tests for VideoPromptStudio (0% coverage)
2. ‚ùå No error handling for Sora API failures
3. ‚ùå No retry logic for transient failures
```

**Impact**: MEDIUM
- New code will be first to have tests in video area
- Existing VideoPromptStudio may break without detection
- Setting precedent for testing discipline

**Resolution**:
1. **Option A**: Add VideoPromptStudio tests as part of this SD (scope creep)
2. **Option B**: Accept 0% coverage for existing code, mandate 80% for new code
3. **Option C**: Create separate SD to add tests to existing video components

**Recommendation**: Option B (scope boundary clear)
- New code (2,700 LOC) gets 80%+ coverage
- Existing code (2,500 LOC) remains untested
- Total coverage: ~46% (acceptable interim state)

**Action**: Document in LEAD‚ÜíPLAN handoff

---

### üìã DEBT #2: No Error Handling in Existing Sora Integration

**Source**: Systems Analyst
**Current State**: No retry logic, no exponential backoff
**Required State**: Comprehensive error handling (per SD scope)

**Problem**:
- Existing RD Department Sora integration has basic error handling only
- No retry logic for transient API failures
- No circuit breaker pattern

**Resolution**:
- New VariantGenerationEngine will implement proper error handling
- Existing integration NOT modified (out of scope)
- Document as known limitation

**Action**: Note in Known Issues & Risks (handoff element #5)

---

## CLARIFICATIONS NEEDED

### ‚ùì CLARIFICATION #1: Phase 0 API Credentials

**Source**: SD Description (Phase 0 section)
**Issue**: SD mentions "Azure OpenAI preview OR OpenAI developer program" but no guidance on which to use

**Questions**:
1. Do we already have Azure OpenAI credentials?
2. Is Sora 2 available via Azure yet? (it may be OpenAI-only)
3. What's the fallback if neither credential works?

**Impact on Phase 0**:
- If Azure: Need Azure subscription + preview access
- If OpenAI: Need OpenAI account + Sora 2 API access (may be waitlist)
- If neither: Phase 0 fails immediately

**Action Needed**: Verify API access BEFORE Phase 0 execution

---

### ‚ùì CLARIFICATION #2: Manual Workflow Cost Estimate

**Source**: SD Description
**Quote**: "If FAIL: budget $1,004/test"

**Questions**:
1. Where does $1,004 come from? (breakdown not provided)
2. Is this per test campaign (12 variants) or per variant?
3. What does "manual workflow" entail exactly?

**Impact**:
- If Phase 0 fails, this becomes the operating cost
- Significant difference: $120 (API) vs $1,004 (manual)
- Need clear definition for business case

**Action Needed**: Document manual workflow cost breakdown

---

### ‚ùì CLARIFICATION #3: "Round 2" Automation Scope

**Source**: SD Scope
**In-Scope**: "Automated iteration engine"

**Questions**:
1. Does "Round 2" mean generating NEW variants based on winner?
2. Or does it mean running the same variants on different platforms?
3. How many iterations are supported? (Round 2, Round 3, etc.)

**Impact**:
- Affects VariantGenerationEngine complexity
- Affects database schema (need iteration tracking?)
- Affects user workflow (when to trigger Round 2?)

**Action Needed**: Clarify iteration model before PLAN phase

## RECOMMENDATIONS TO INCORPORATE

### ‚úÖ RECOMMENDATION #1: Two-Step Migration for Circular FK

**Source**: Database Architect (CRITICAL safety measure)
**Current Approach**: Not specified in SD
**Recommended Approach**: Explicit two-step migration

**Migration Order**:
```sql
-- Step 1: Create variant_groups WITHOUT winner FK
CREATE TABLE variant_groups (...);

-- Step 2: Create video_variants
CREATE TABLE video_variants (...);

-- Step 3: Add winner FK to variant_groups
ALTER TABLE variant_groups
  ADD CONSTRAINT fk_winner_variant
  FOREIGN KEY (winner_variant_id) REFERENCES video_variants(id);
```

**Rationale**: Prevents circular FK constraint errors

**Action**: Include in PLAN‚ÜíEXEC handoff database guidance

---

### ‚úÖ RECOMMENDATION #2: Partitioning Strategy for Metrics

**Source**: Database Architect (performance optimization)
**Current Approach**: Single variant_performance table
**Recommended Approach**: Monthly partitions

**Implementation**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE variant_performance (...)
PARTITION BY RANGE (recorded_at);

CREATE TABLE variant_performance_2025_01
  PARTITION OF variant_performance
  FOR VALUES FROM ('2025-01-01') TO ('2025-02-01');
```

**Rationale**: Prevents table bloat (375K rows/year)

**Action**: Include in database migration plan (Week 1)

---

### ‚úÖ RECOMMENDATION #3: Progressive Disclosure in UI

**Source**: Design Sub-Agent (UX simplification)
**Current Approach**: Show all options
**Recommended Approach**: Hide advanced options behind toggle

**Example**:
```tsx
<VariantGenerationEngine>
  <BasicOptions>
    <VariantCountSlider />
    <TestStrategyRadio />
  </BasicOptions>

  <Collapsible label="Advanced Options">
    <MutationDimensions />
    <TestMatrixPreview />
  </Collapsible>
</VariantGenerationEngine>
```

**Rationale**: Reduces cognitive load for new users

**Action**: Include in UI/UX specifications (PLAN phase)

---

## RISK MITIGATION GAPS

### ‚ö†Ô∏è GAP #1: No Rollback Testing Plan

**Source**: Database Architect mentions rollback scripts but no testing
**Current State**: Rollback scripts will be written
**Missing**: Rollback drill before production

**Recommendation**:
- Week 1, Day 3: Test rollback on staging
- Verify data integrity after rollback
- Document rollback time (target: <30 minutes)

**Action**: Add to Week 1 migration checklist

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è GAP #2: No User Testing Plan

**Source**: Design Sub-Agent recommends user testing but no details
**Current State**: "User testing after Phase 2"
**Missing**: Specific criteria, participants, success metrics

**Recommendation**:
```
User Testing Plan (Week 5):
- Participants: 3-5 portfolio ventures
- Tasks: Complete full variant test workflow
- Metrics: Time to complete, error rate, satisfaction score
- Success Criteria: <15 min active time, 0 critical issues, >4/5 satisfaction
```

**Action**: Create user testing plan in PLAN phase

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è GAP #3: No Monitoring Alert Thresholds

**Source**: Database Architect recommends monitoring but no thresholds
**Current State**: "Monitor query performance, table growth"
**Missing**: Specific alert triggers

**Recommendation**:
```
Alert Thresholds:
- Query P95 > 200ms: WARNING
- Query P95 > 500ms: CRITICAL
- Table growth > 10% per week: WARNING
- Table growth > 50% per week: CRITICAL
- Disk usage > 80%: WARNING
- Disk usage > 90%: CRITICAL
```

**Action**: Define monitoring thresholds in PLAN phase

---

## SCOPE CREEP RISKS

### üö® CREEP RISK #1: "Integration with Existing Workflows"

**Source**: SD mentions "Stage 34/35 automation" but unclear scope
**Concern**: Workflow automation could expand significantly

**Current Scope**:
```
"in_scope": [
  "Stage 34/35 automation"  // ‚Üê Vague
]
```

**Questions**:
1. Which specific stages? (34, 35, or both?)
2. What triggers variant generation? (manual, automatic, conditional?)
3. What happens after winner identified? (auto-deploy, notify, archive?)

**Risk**: Could add 200-400 LOC of workflow integration code

**Recommendation**: Clarify exact integration points before EXEC phase

---

### üö® CREEP RISK #2: "Chairman Approval Integration"

**Source**: SD mentions Chairman approval but no details on flow
**Concern**: Approval workflows can be complex

**Current Scope**:
```
"in_scope": [
  "Chairman approval integration"  // ‚Üê Vague
]
```

**Questions**:
1. What requires approval? (winner selection only, or variant generation too?)
2. What if Chairman rejects? (re-run analysis, manual override, escalate?)
3. Is this blocking (wait for approval) or async (notify + continue)?

**Risk**: Could add ChairmanApprovalModal + approval state management (200 LOC)

**Recommendation**: Define minimal approval workflow (winner selection only)

---

## PRIORITIZED ACTIONS

### IMMEDIATE (Before Phase 0)

1. **‚úÖ Verify Sora 2 API Access**
   - Check if we have Azure OpenAI credentials OR OpenAI Sora 2 access
   - If neither, Phase 0 will fail immediately
   - Estimated time: 15 minutes

2. **‚ö†Ô∏è DECIDE: Backlog Items**
   - Option A: Create 17 backlog items from SD scope
   - Option B: Proceed without backlog (document exception)
   - Option C: Mark SD as draft until backlog created
   - Estimated time: 30 minutes (Option A) or 5 minutes (Options B/C)

3. **‚ö†Ô∏è Clarify "Round 2" Iteration Model**
   - Define: What does automated iteration mean?
   - Confirm: How many rounds supported?
   - Estimated time: 10 minutes

---

### BEFORE PLAN PHASE

4. **Update SD Scope** (incorporate sub-agent recommendations):
   - Change "3 new database tables" ‚Üí "4 new database tables"
   - Add component sizing requirement (<600 LOC)
   - Add Week 4 checkpoint
   - Clarify Stage 34/35 integration scope
   - Clarify Chairman approval workflow
   - Estimated time: 20 minutes

5. **Document Manual Workflow Cost Breakdown**
   - Explain $1,004/test calculation
   - Define manual workflow steps
   - Estimated time: 15 minutes

---

### BEFORE EXEC PHASE

6. **Create Database Migration Checklist** (Week 1):
   - Two-step migration for circular FK
   - Rollback testing plan
   - Partitioning strategy for metrics
   - Monitoring alert thresholds
   - Estimated time: Handled by PLAN agent

7. **Create User Testing Plan** (Week 5):
   - 3-5 participants
   - Task list
   - Success criteria
   - Estimated time: Handled by PLAN agent
