# API Access Verification & Clarifications
## SD-VIDEO-VARIANT-001

**Date**: 2025-10-10
**Status**: PRE-PHASE 0 VERIFICATION

---

## 1. Sora 2 API Access Verification

### Finding: OpenAI API Key EXISTS

**Location**: `/mnt/c/_EHG/EHG_Engineer/.env`
**Key Format**: `sk-proj-...` (Project-scoped OpenAI key)

**Status**: ⚠️ **UNCERTAIN** - Key exists but Sora 2 access unconfirmed

### Critical Questions for Phase 0:

#### Q1: Does this OpenAI key have Sora 2 API access?
**Background**: Sora 2 API is in limited preview (as of Jan 2025)
**Access Requirements**:
- OpenAI account enrolled in Sora early access program
- OR Azure OpenAI preview access
- Typical waitlist: Weeks to months

**Verification Method** (Phase 0 smoke test):
```bash
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/video/generations \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "prompt": "A serene sunset over mountains",
    "duration": 15,
    "model": "sora-2.0"
  }'
```

**Expected Outcomes**:
- ✅ **200 OK** + job_id → API access confirmed, Phase 0 PASS
- ❌ **401 Unauthorized** → API key invalid, Phase 0 FAIL
- ❌ **403 Forbidden** → No Sora access, Phase 0 FAIL
- ❌ **404 Not Found** → Sora 2 endpoint doesn't exist yet, Phase 0 FAIL

**Risk**: HIGH (50% chance Phase 0 fails due to no Sora access)

---

#### Q2: Azure OpenAI Alternative?
**Status**: No Azure credentials found in environment

**Azure OpenAI Sora Access**:
- Requires: Azure subscription + OpenAI resource + Sora preview enrollment
- Endpoint: `https://{resource}.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/{deployment}/video/generations`
- Not found in current .env files

**Conclusion**: Azure is NOT an option currently

---

#### Q3: Fallback if Phase 0 Fails?
**SD Specifies**: Manual workflow ($1,004/test vs $120 API)

**Manual Workflow** (documented below):
1. EXEC agent generates 12-20 text prompts (VariantGenerationEngine output)
2. User copies prompts to Sora web interface (sora.openai.com or similar)
3. User manually generates videos (one by one)
4. User uploads videos to PerformanceTrackingDashboard
5. Continue workflow without API automation

**Implications**:
- Phase 0 failure does NOT block SD
- Scope reduces: No API integration, no async job queue, no cost tracking
- Effort reduces: ~400 LOC removed (video_generation_jobs table, API wrapper, webhook handlers)
- Cost increases: $1,004/test manual vs $120 automated

### RECOMMENDATION

**Before Phase 0 Execution**:
1. ✅ Accept that we have an OpenAI API key (found)
2. ⚠️ Acknowledge Sora 2 access is UNCERTAIN (will test in Phase 0)
3. ✅ Prepare for manual workflow fallback (documented below)
4. ⏱️ Budget 2 hours for Phase 0 smoke test
5. 💰 Budget $10-15 for test video generation (if API works)

**Proceed to Phase 0**: ✅ YES (we have API key, worst case is manual fallback)

## 2. Round 2 Iteration Model - CLARIFICATION

### SD States:
> "Automated iteration engine"
> "Auto-generate Round 2 variants based on winner (mutation strategies)"

### Interpretation:

**"Round 2" means**:
- **AFTER** identifying a winner from initial test (12-20 variants)
- **GENERATE** new variants by mutating the winner prompt
- **PURPOSE**: Iterative optimization (Round 1 → Round 2 → Round 3, etc.)

**Example**:
- Round 1: Test 12 variants → Winner: Variant A (8.2% engagement)
- Round 2: Generate 8 new variants by mutating Variant A prompt
  - Mutation 1: Shorten from 30s → 15s
  - Mutation 2: Change tone from "excited" → "urgent"
  - Mutation 3: Add call-to-action at end
  - Etc.
- Round 2 Test: Test 8 new variants → Winner: Round 2 Variant C (9.5% engagement)
- Round 3: (Optional) Further refinement

---

### Mutation Strategies

**Defined in SD**:
- Hill climbing (small adjustments)
- Genetic algorithms (crossover winning traits)

**Concrete Examples**:

#### Hill Climbing (Incremental)
```
Winner Prompt: "Excited founder shares breakthrough in 30-second video with cinematic style"

Mutations:
1. Length: 30s → 20s
2. Tone: Excited → Enthusiastic
3. Style: Cinematic → Raw/Authentic
4. Ending: Default → Add CTA
```

#### Genetic Algorithm (Crossover)
```
Winner A: "Calm founder explains product in 15s with minimalist style"
Winner B: "Energetic founder demos feature in 30s with dynamic camera"

Crossover Mutations:
1. Calm + Dynamic camera (combine traits)
2. Energetic + Minimalist (combine traits)
3. 15s + Demo feature (combine traits)
```

---

### Database Schema Impact

**Required Fields** (for tracking iterations):

```sql
ALTER TABLE video_variants
  ADD COLUMN iteration_round INTEGER DEFAULT 1,
  ADD COLUMN parent_variant_id UUID REFERENCES video_variants(id), -- Which variant did we mutate?
  ADD COLUMN mutation_strategy VARCHAR(50); -- 'hill_climbing', 'genetic', 'random'
```

**Required Fields** (for variant_groups):

```sql
ALTER TABLE variant_groups
  ADD COLUMN current_round INTEGER DEFAULT 1,
  ADD COLUMN max_rounds INTEGER DEFAULT 3; -- Stop after N rounds
```

---

### User Workflow

**Step 1**: Generate Round 1 (12 variants)
**Step 2**: Collect performance data (1-2 weeks)
**Step 3**: Identify winner (WinnerIdentificationPanel)
**Step 4**: Click "Generate Round 2" button
**Step 5**: System auto-generates 8 new variants based on winner
**Step 6**: Repeat steps 2-5 for Round 3, 4, etc.

---

### Component Impact

**WinnerIdentificationPanel.tsx** needs:
- "Generate Round 2" button (calls VariantGenerationEngine with mutation mode)
- Display: "This is Round 1. Generate Round 2 based on winner?"

**VariantGenerationEngine.ts** needs:
- `generateMutations(winnerVariant, strategy, count)` function
- Mutation strategies: hill climbing, genetic crossover

**PerformanceTrackingDashboard.tsx** needs:
- Round indicator: "Round 1: 12 variants" vs "Round 2: 8 variants"
- Lineage view: Show parent → child relationships

---

### Scope Impact

**Estimated LOC Addition**:
- Mutation engine: +150 LOC (VariantGenerationEngine.ts)
- Round tracking UI: +80 LOC (WinnerIdentificationPanel.tsx)
- Database fields: +3 columns (iteration_round, parent_variant_id, mutation_strategy)
- **Total**: +230 LOC

**Complexity**: MEDIUM (algorithmic logic for mutations)

---

### CLARIFICATION DECISION

**Definition**: "Round 2" = Generate NEW variants by mutating the winner from Round 1

**Scope**: ✅ IN SCOPE (explicitly listed in SD)

**Requirements**:
1. Database schema supports iteration tracking
2. WinnerIdentificationPanel has "Generate Round 2" button
3. VariantGenerationEngine implements mutation strategies (hill climbing minimum)
4. Support up to 3 rounds (configurable max_rounds)

**Action**: Include in PLAN→EXEC handoff database schema requirements

## 3. Manual Workflow Cost Breakdown - $1,004/Test

### SD States:
> "If Phase 0 fails → Manual workflow, budget $1,004 per test"

### Cost Breakdown Analysis

**Assumption**: Manual workflow for 12 variants

#### Labor Costs

**Activity 1: Prompt Generation** (Already automated)
- Time: 5 minutes (VariantGenerationEngine output)
- Cost: $0 (EXEC agent generates prompts)

**Activity 2: Manual Video Generation** (12 videos)
- Platform: Sora web interface (sora.openai.com or similar)
- Time per video: 5 minutes (paste prompt, wait, download)
- Total time: 60 minutes
- Hourly rate: $150/hour (venture team member)
- **Cost: $150**

**Activity 3: Video Upload & Metadata Entry** (12 videos)
- Time per video: 3 minutes (upload, add metadata, link to variant)
- Total time: 36 minutes
- Hourly rate: $150/hour
- **Cost: $90**

**Activity 4: Performance Data Entry** (12 variants × 5 platforms = 60 metric entries)
- Time per entry: 2 minutes (copy from Instagram/TikTok/etc. to dashboard)
- Total time: 120 minutes
- Hourly rate: $150/hour
- **Cost: $300**

**Activity 5: Video Generation API Costs** (12 videos)
- Sora web interface cost: ~$6/video (20-second video)
- Total: 12 × $6 = **$72**

**Activity 6: Platform Ad Spend** (Testing the videos)
- Minimum viable test: $50 per platform × 5 platforms = **$250**
- OR organic testing (free, but 1-2 weeks longer)

**Activity 7: Analysis Time** (Winner identification)
- Time: 30 minutes (manual comparison, not automated)
- Hourly rate: $150/hour
- **Cost: $75**
