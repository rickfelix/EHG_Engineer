# Stage 2: Recursion Blueprint

**Status**: ❌ **No Recursion Support**

---

## Recursion Analysis

**Consistency Scan Result**: N/N/N (No recursion detected)

**Evidence**: Stage 2 critique does not contain recursion section; unified venture system (SD-VENTURE-UNIFICATION-001) does not list Stage 2 as recursion target.

---

## Inbound Recursion Triggers

**None defined**

Stage 2 is not a target for recursion from downstream stages in current implementation.

---

## Outbound Recursion Triggers

**Theoretical**: Stage 2 could trigger recursion back to Stage 1 if:
- Multi-model analysis reveals fundamental problem definition flaws
- Contrarian review identifies critical missing assumptions
- Risk assessment uncovers showstopper issues

**Implementation Status**: ❌ Not implemented

---

## Loop Prevention

**Not applicable** (no recursion support)

---

## Future Considerations

**Potential Recursion Scenarios**:
1. **MKT-001 trigger from Stage 5+**: If market validation contradicts AI review assumptions, return to Stage 2 with updated data
2. **QUALITY-001 trigger from Stage 10+**: If technical review reveals AI missed critical risks, re-run multi-model analysis

**Tracking Requirements** (if implemented):
- Add `recursion_events` table entry
- Log `recursion_count_for_stage`
- Store `trigger_data` (e.g., `{"contradicted_assumption": "market size", "new_data_source": "primary research"}`)

**Evidence**: No recursion support per consistency scan; theoretical triggers inferred from Stage 3 recursion model (stage-03.md:29-86)
