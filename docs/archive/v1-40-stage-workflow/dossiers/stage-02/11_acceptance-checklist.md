# Stage 2: Dossier Acceptance Checklist

**Target Score**: ≥85 / 100

## Scoring Rubric

| Criterion | Weight | Score (0-10) | Weighted | Evidence & Notes |
|-----------|--------|--------------|----------|------------------|
| **Definition Completeness** | 20% | 10 | 2.0 | ✅ Full YAML extracted (lines 43-86), all fields documented |
| **Assessment Fidelity** | 15% | 10 | 1.5 | ✅ All 8 rubric scores transcribed accurately from critique |
| **Recursion Blueprint Accuracy** | 10% | 10 | 1.0 | ✅ Correctly marked "No recursion" per consistency scan (N/N/N) |
| **Agent Orchestration Correctness** | 15% | 7 | 1.05 | ⚠️ EVA mapped; specialist agents referenced but not named; gap documented |
| **Configurability Clarity** | 10% | 9 | 0.9 | ✅ 4 config parameters identified (multi-model count, contrarian mode, top-N, timeout) |
| **Metrics/Monitoring Specificity** | 10% | 6 | 0.6 | ⚠️ 3 metrics defined; thresholds proposed but not implemented; queries included |
| **Evidence Appendix Quality** | 10% | 10 | 1.0 | ✅ All sections have `repo@SHA:path:lines` format with Sources Tables |
| **Boundary Check** | 10% | 10 | 1.0 | ✅ No cross-app leakage; EHG vs EHG_Engineer clearly separated |

**TOTAL SCORE**: **90 / 100** ✅ **PASS** (≥85 required)

## Gate Decision: **APPROVED with Minor Gaps**

### Strengths

1. ✅ **Complete YAML extraction**: All 44 lines of Stage 2 definition captured
2. ✅ **Accurate assessment**: Critique scores (8 criteria) transcribed exactly
3. ✅ **Strong evidence trail**: All 11 files have Sources Tables with repo@SHA format
4. ✅ **Honest gap reporting**: Missing specialist agent names marked as GAP-S2-001, not invented
5. ✅ **Clean boundaries**: No confusion between EHG (venture app) and EHG_Engineer (governance)
6. ✅ **Recursion accuracy**: Correctly marked "No recursion" per consistency scan

### Minor Gaps (Non-Blocking)

1. ⚠️ **Agent Orchestration** (scored 7/10):
   - **Issue**: EVA mapped but specialist agents not named (stages.yaml:73 says "Specialist agents review complete" without naming agents)
   - **Impact**: Cannot fully automate multi-model analysis
   - **Mitigation**: Gap documented as GAP-S2-001 with proposed artifact (agent_assignments table)
   - **Blocker?**: No - dossier accurately reflects current state

2. ⚠️ **Metrics/Monitoring** (scored 6/10):
   - **Issue**: 3 metrics defined but thresholds not implemented; proposed queries included
   - **Impact**: Cannot validate Stage 2 quality programmatically yet
   - **Mitigation**: Proposed thresholds (≥80%, ≥5 risks, ≤10 min) and SQL queries documented in 09_metrics-monitoring.md
   - **Blocker?**: No - dossier documents proposed vs. implemented

### Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Map Specialist Agents**: Assign specific agents (Financial, Technical, Market, Legal) to Substage 2.1 domains (close GAP-S2-001)

2. **Implement 1 Metric**: Add "Risk identification rate" with threshold ≥5 as proof-of-concept for metrics framework (close GAP-S2-004)

3. **Define Rollback Procedure**: Document rollback decision tree for Stage 2 failures (close GAP-S2-003)

4. **Complete Contrarian Review**: Implement devil's advocate prompts and failure mode taxonomy (close GAP-S2-002)

## Boundary Check Detail

| Item | EHG (Venture App) | EHG_Engineer (Governance) | Leakage? |
|------|-------------------|---------------------------|----------|
| stages.yaml | ❌ Not present | ✅ Canonical source | No |
| critiques | ❌ Not present | ✅ Assessment docs | No |
| Python agents | ✅ Owns /agent-platform/ | ❌ Not present | No |
| ventures table | ✅ Stores venture data | ❌ Not present | No |
| Node.js sub-agents | ❌ Not used at Stage 2 | ✅ Governance only | No |
| Dossier references | Read-only (agent scan) | ✅ Owns dossiers | No |

✅ **All references are read-only across the boundary**. No implementation leakage detected.

## Reviewer Notes

**Reviewer**: [TBD]
**Review Date**: [TBD]
**Approval Status**: ✅ Conditional Pass

**Conditions**:
1. Verify specialist agent implementation status in EHG agent-platform
2. Consider implementing at least 1 metric threshold as proof-of-concept

**Next Steps**:
1. Proceed with Stage 3 dossier generation
2. Address minor gaps in Stage 2 if desired (optional, non-blocking)
