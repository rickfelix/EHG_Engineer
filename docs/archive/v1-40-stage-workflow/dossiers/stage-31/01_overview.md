## Customer Touchpoint Significance

**Why 4/5 UX/Customer Signal**:
- **Direct User Acquisition**: First contact with real customers at scale
- **Real-time Feedback**: Immediate user responses to live product
- **Engagement Metrics**: Actual usage patterns measured, not simulated
- **Support Interactions**: Live customer support requests reveal usability issues
- **Marketing Effectiveness**: Customer response to messaging and positioning

**Cross-Stage Impact**:
