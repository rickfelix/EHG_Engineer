# Stage 9: Stage Map & Workflow Position

**Purpose**: Visualize Stage 9's position in the 40-stage venture lifecycle and its dependency relationships.

---

## Dependency Graph

```
[Stage 8]
Problem Decomposition Engine
↓
[Stage 9] ← YOU ARE HERE
Gap Analysis & Market Opportunity Modeling
↓
[Stage 10]
Comprehensive Technical Review
```

**Evidence**: EHG_Engineer@6ef8cf4:docs/workflow/stages.yaml:367-369 "depends_on: [8]"

---

## Workflow Position

**Phase**: Ideation (Stages 1-10)
**Position**: 9 of 40 stages (22.5% through venture lifecycle)
**Critical Path**: Yes (gap analysis informs technical feasibility and execution planning)

**Upstream Dependencies**: 1 direct (Stage 8)
**Downstream Impact**: 1 direct (Stage 10), indirect impact on all execution stages (11-40)

**Evidence**: EHG_Engineer@6ef8cf4:docs/workflow/stages.yaml:365-409 "id: 9, depends_on: [8]"

---

## Data Flow

### Inputs (from Stage 8)
1. **Current capabilities** - What the organization can currently deliver
2. **Market requirements** - What customers/market demands
3. **Competitor analysis** - What competitors are offering

**Evidence**: EHG_Engineer@6ef8cf4:docs/workflow/stages.yaml:371-374 "inputs: Current capabilities, Market requirements"

### Outputs (to Stage 10)
1. **Gap analysis report** - Documented capability gaps with severity
2. **Opportunity matrix** - Prioritized market opportunities with ROI
3. **Capability roadmap** - Plan to close gaps and capture opportunities

**Evidence**: EHG_Engineer@6ef8cf4:docs/workflow/stages.yaml:375-378 "outputs: Gap analysis report, Opportunity matrix"

## Substage Flow

```
9.1 Capability Assessment
├─ Current state documented
├─ Required capabilities listed
↓
9.2 Gap Identification
├─ Gaps catalogued
├─ Severity assessed
├─ Priority assigned
↓
9.3 Opportunity Modeling
├─ Opportunities mapped
├─ Market size estimated
└─ ROI projected
```

**Evidence**: EHG_Engineer@6ef8cf4:docs/workflow/stages.yaml:387-407 "substages: 9.1, 9.2, 9.3"

## Critical Path Analysis

**Why Stage 9 is Critical**:
1. **Prevents Over-Promising**: Gap analysis ensures venture commitments are grounded in reality
2. **Prioritizes Build vs Buy**: Capability roadmap identifies where to build in-house vs acquire/partner
3. **Informs Resource Planning**: Gaps inform hiring, training, and tooling requirements in later stages
4. **Market Validation**: Opportunity modeling validates there's sufficient market demand for proposed solution

**Risk if Skipped**: Venture proceeds with unrealistic assumptions about internal capabilities, leading to execution failures or missed market opportunities.

**Evidence**: EHG_Engineer@6ef8cf4:docs/workflow/critique/stage-09.md:56-60 "Upstream Dependencies: 8, Downstream Impact: Stages 10"

---

## Integration Points

### Stage 8 (Problem Decomposition)
- **Receives**: Task breakdown from WBS (Work Breakdown Structure)
- **Uses**: To assess if organization has capabilities to execute each task
- **Gap Risk**: If Stage 8 decomposition is too optimistic, gaps may be underestimated

**Evidence**: EHG_Engineer@6ef8cf4:docs/workflow/stages.yaml:367-369 "depends_on: [8]"

### Stage 10 (Technical Review)
- **Provides**: Gap analysis report and capability roadmap
- **Enables**: Technical review to assess feasibility with realistic capability constraints
- **Integration**: Technical review may discover Stage 9 missed critical capability gaps

**Evidence**: EHG_Engineer@6ef8cf4:docs/workflow/critique/stage-09.md:58 "Downstream Impact: Stages 10"
