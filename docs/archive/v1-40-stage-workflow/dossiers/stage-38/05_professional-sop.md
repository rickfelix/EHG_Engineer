## Error Handling & Escalation

### Common Errors

#### Error 1: Market Data Unavailable
**Symptoms**: Market indicators cannot be tracked due to data source failure
**Immediate Action**: Switch to backup data sources, use proxy indicators
**Escalation**: If unresolved within 2 days, escalate to LEAD
**Prevention**: Configure redundant data sources in Step 1.1

#### Error 2: Timing Decision Deferred
**Symptoms**: LEAD defers timing decision due to insufficient confidence or external factors
**Immediate Action**: Document deferral rationale, identify information gaps
**Next Steps**: Conduct additional analysis, gather more data, reschedule decision review
**Timeline**: Re-attempt decision within 1 week

#### Error 3: Resource Unavailability
**Symptoms**: Required resources not available at planned timing
**Immediate Action**: Identify resource gaps, explore alternatives
**Escalation**: Escalate to LEAD for priority adjustment or timing modification
**Mitigation**: Build resource buffer (20%) in execution calendar

#### Error 4: Competitive Pre-emption
**Symptoms**: Competitor launches similar product before our timing window
**Immediate Action**: Reassess timing decision, evaluate market impact
**Next Steps**: Update competitive analysis, consider timing adjustment or differentiation strategy
**Escalation**: Immediate escalation to LEAD for strategic decision

### Escalation Path
1. **Level 1**: Agent identifies issue → Reports to Execution Coordinator
2. **Level 2**: Execution Coordinator → Escalates to Strategic Timing Advisor
3. **Level 3**: Strategic Timing Advisor → Escalates to LEAD
4. **Level 4**: LEAD → Escalates to Executive Team (portfolio-level conflicts only)

### Rollback Procedures

#### Rollback Trigger Conditions
- Market conditions deteriorate significantly (key indicators breach critical thresholds)
- Competitive landscape shifts dramatically (major competitor pre-emption)
- Internal readiness fails (critical resources unavailable, dependencies blocked)
- LEAD determines strategic priorities changed

#### Rollback Execution Steps
1. **Immediate**: Pause resource mobilization, freeze commitments
2. **Assessment**: Evaluate rollback impact, identify affected stakeholders
3. **Decision**: LEAD approves rollback or alternative path forward
4. **Communication**: Notify all stakeholders of rollback decision and rationale
5. **Re-analysis**: Return to Step 2.1 (Identify Timing Options) with updated conditions
6. **Timeline**: Complete rollback assessment and decision within 3 days

## Metrics & KPIs
