## Executive Summary

**Stage ID**: 25
**Title**: Quality Assurance
**Phase**: Execution (Stages 21-31)
**Depends On**: 24 (MVP Engine: Automated Feedback Iteration)
**Next Stage**: 26 (Security & Compliance)

Stage 25 executes comprehensive quality assurance and testing processes including test execution, bug management, and quality certification. This stage ensures all quality criteria are met before security review and production release.

**Maturity**: Template stage (no implementation evidence)
**Automation Level**: Manual → Assisted → Auto (suggested)
**Critical Path**: Yes (blocks security review and release)

**Key Metrics**: Test coverage, Defect density, Quality score
**Primary Exit Gates**: Tests passed, Quality certified, Release approved

## Regeneration Notes

**Commands Used** (read-only; no DB writes):

```bash
# 1. Extract stage definition from YAML
cat docs/workflow/stages.yaml | sed -n '1103,1148p'

# Output: Stage 25 definition (46 lines)

# 2. Read critique assessment
cat docs/workflow/critique/stage-25.md

# Output: 72 lines, 2.9/5 overall score

# 3. Generate dossier files (this document and 10 others)
# node scripts/generate-stage-dossier.js --stage=25 --output=docs/workflow/dossiers/stage-25/
```

## Strategic Context

**Universal Blocker**: SD-METRICS-FRAMEWORK-001 (Priority: CRITICAL, affects all stages including QA metrics definition)

**Proposed Directives**:
- SD-QA-AUTOMATION-001 (Priority: high) - Automate test execution, bug tracking, and quality certification
- SD-CRITIQUE-TEMPLATE-UPDATE-001 (proposed in Phase 9) - Add QA-specific rubric criteria

**Cross-Stage Dependencies**:
- Receives MVP feedback from Stage 24 (iteration results)
- Provides quality certification to Stage 26 (Security & Compliance)
- May recurse to Stages 22-24 if critical defects found

**Next**: See `02_stage-map.md` for dependency graph and workflow position.
