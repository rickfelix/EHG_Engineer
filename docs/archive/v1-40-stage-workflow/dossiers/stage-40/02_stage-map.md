## Upstream Dependencies

| Stage ID | Title | Relationship | Evidence |
|----------|-------|--------------|----------|
| 39 | Venture Mature | **Direct Blocker** | EHG_Engineer@6ef8cf4:docs/workflow/stages.yaml:1797-1798 |

**Entry Requirements**:
- Stage 39 complete (Venture Mature)
- Venture mature (entry gate)
- Metrics positive (entry gate)

**Evidence**: EHG_Engineer@6ef8cf4:docs/workflow/stages.yaml:1812-1815

---

## Downstream Impact

**NONE - Terminal Stage**

Stage 40 is the **FINAL stage** in the 40-stage workflow. No stages depend on Stage 40.

**Evidence**: EHG_Engineer@6ef8cf4:docs/workflow/stages.yaml:1-1839 (full scan shows no `depends_on: [40]`)

---

## Critical Path Analysis

**Critical Path Status**: ❌ Not on Critical Path

**Reasoning**:
- Stage 40 is terminal (no downstream dependencies)
- Delays in Stage 40 do not block other work
- However, Stage 40 represents the ultimate goal of all prior stages

**Evidence**: No stages list `depends_on: [40]` in stages.yaml

---

## Parallel Execution Opportunities

**None Available**: Stage 40 is sequential with Stage 39 and represents ongoing operations.

**Concurrency Model**: Stage 40 can manage multiple ventures simultaneously (each venture has independent lifecycle).

---

## Stage Progression Flow

**From Stage 39 to Stage 40**:
1. Stage 39 exit gates satisfied:
   - Venture proven
   - Operations scaled
   - Team matured
2. Stage 40 entry gates satisfied:
   - Venture mature
   - Metrics positive
3. Stage 40 begins: Growth Management (40.1)

**From Stage 40 to Exit**:
1. Growth optimized (40.1 complete)
2. Exit prepared (40.2 complete)
3. Value realized (40.3 complete)
4. Transaction closed
5. Value distributed
6. Venture lifecycle complete

**Evidence**: EHG_Engineer@6ef8cf4:docs/workflow/stages.yaml:1812-1837

## Workflow Visualization

```
IDEATION (1-10) → VALIDATION (11-20) → DEVELOPMENT (21-30) →
EXECUTION (31-38) → MATURITY (39) → [ACTIVE] (40) → EXIT
```

Stage 40 Position: **TERMINAL STEADY-STATE**
