# Stage 40: Venture Active — Operating Dossier

**Generated**: 2025-11-06
**Version**: 1.0
**Protocol**: Stage Operating Dossier v1.0

---

## Executive Summary

**Stage ID**: 40
**Title**: Venture Active
**Phase**: Venture Management (Stage 40 - **FINAL STAGE**)
**Depends On**: 39 (Venture Mature)
**Next Stage**: None (terminal stage - ongoing management)

Stage 40 represents active venture management with growth optimization and exit readiness. This is the **FINAL and ONGOING** stage in the 40-stage workflow, representing continuous venture operations, growth management, and eventual value realization through exit.

**Maturity**: ⚠️ Pending Implementation
**Automation Level**: Manual → Assisted → Auto (suggested)
**Critical Path**: No (terminal stage; no downstream dependencies)

**Key Metrics**: Growth rate, Valuation, Exit readiness score
**Primary Exit Gates**: Growth optimized, Exit executed, Value captured

**Special Note**: Unlike all previous stages, Stage 40 is not transient - it represents the steady-state operation of a mature venture until exit.
