## Field-by-Field Analysis

### Core Identity
- **id**: `40`
- **title**: `"Venture Active"`
- **description**: `"Active venture management with growth optimization and exit readiness."`

### Dependencies
- **depends_on**: `[39]` (Venture Mature)
- **blocks**: None (terminal stage)

### Data Flow
- **inputs** (3):
  1. Venture performance
  2. Market conditions
  3. Exit opportunities

- **outputs** (3):
  1. Growth decisions
  2. Exit timing
  3. Value realization

### Measurement
- **metrics** (3):
  1. Growth rate
  2. Valuation
  3. Exit readiness score

### Quality Gates
- **entry** (2 criteria):
  1. Venture mature
  2. Metrics positive

- **exit** (3 criteria):
  1. Growth optimized
  2. Exit executed
  3. Value captured

### Substages
- **40.1**: Growth Management (3 done_when criteria)
- **40.2**: Exit Preparation (3 done_when criteria)
- **40.3**: Value Realization (3 done_when criteria)

### Automation Notes
- **progression_mode**: `Manual → Assisted → Auto (suggested)`

---

## Interpretation Notes

### Terminal Stage Characteristics
1. **No downstream dependencies**: No other stages reference Stage 40
2. **Indefinite duration**: Unlike transient stages, Stage 40 continues until exit
3. **Exit-oriented**: All substages lead toward value realization
4. **Chairman-owned**: Highest-level strategic decisions

### Progression Model
- **Manual**: Chairman reviews metrics and makes decisions manually
- **Assisted**: AI provides growth recommendations and exit timing analysis
- **Auto**: Automated monitoring with exception-based escalation

### Substage Sequence
Stage 40 substages are **partially overlapping**:
- 40.1 (Growth Management): Ongoing throughout Stage 40
- 40.2 (Exit Preparation): Begins when exit conditions favorable
- 40.3 (Value Realization): Final phase, triggered by exit decision
