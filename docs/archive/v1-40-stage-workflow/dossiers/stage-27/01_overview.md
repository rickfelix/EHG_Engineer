# Stage 27: Actor Model & Saga Transaction Integration — Operating Dossier

**Generated**: 2025-11-06
**Version**: 1.0
**Protocol**: Stage Operating Dossier v1.0

## Venture Selection

**Active Venture Detected**:
- **ID**: `45a8fd77-96f7-4f83-9e28-385d3ef4c431`
- **Name**: E2E Direct Access Test 1762206208294
- **Status**: active
- **Current Workflow Stage**: 1
- **Created**: 2025-11-03T21:43:35.469572+00:00

**Selection Rule**: Highest `current_workflow_stage` among ventures WHERE `status = 'active'` ORDER BY `current_workflow_stage` DESC, `created_at` DESC LIMIT 1

## Executive Summary

**Stage ID**: 27
**Title**: Actor Model & Saga Transaction Integration
**Phase**: Execution (Stages 11-40)
**Depends On**: Stage 26 (Security Validation)
**Next Stage**: 28 (Caching & Performance Optimization)

Stage 27 implements distributed transaction patterns using the actor model and saga orchestration. This stage introduces event sourcing, compensating transactions, and supervision strategies for complex distributed workflows.

**Maturity**: ❌ Not Implemented (template-based critique only)
**Automation Level**: Manual → Assisted → Auto (suggested from stages.yaml notes)
**Critical Path**: No (feeds into optimization stages)

**Key Metrics**: Transaction success rate, Latency metrics, Consistency score
**Primary Exit Gates**: Actors implemented, Sagas tested, Consistency verified

## Regeneration Notes

**Commands Used** (read-only; no DB writes):

```bash
# 1. Extract Stage 27 definition from canonical YAML
cat docs/workflow/stages.yaml | sed -n '1195,1240p'

# 2. Read critique assessment
cat docs/workflow/critique/stage-27.md

# 3. Detect current active venture stage (for venture selection context)
node scripts/detect-current-stage.mjs

# 4. Generate dossier files (this document and 10 others)
# (No script execution; manual generation per Phase 10 requirements)
```

**Evidence Extraction**: All facts sourced from repo files with commit SHAs (EHG_Engineer@6ef8cf4, EHG@0d80dac).

**Reproducibility**: Run commands above at specified commits to verify all claims.
