# Stage 4: Metrics & Monitoring

**Source**: EHG_Engineer@6ef8cf4:docs/workflow/stages.yaml:148-150

## Defined Metrics (from stages.yaml)

| Metric | Definition | Threshold | Implementation Status |
|--------|------------|-----------|----------------------|
| **Market coverage** | % of total addressable market (TAM) covered by competitor analysis | ≥80% | ⚠️ Proposed |
| **Competitor identification** | Count of direct + indirect competitors identified | ≥5 total | ⚠️ Proposed |
| **Differentiation score** | Strength of USP and competitive moat (0-100 scale) | ≥70 | ⚠️ Proposed |

**Evidence**: EHG_Engineer@6ef8cf4:docs/workflow/stages.yaml:148-150

## Proposed Monitoring Queries

### 1. Market Coverage

**SQL** (proposed):
```sql
-- Calculate % of TAM covered by competitor analysis
SELECT
  venture_id,
  (SUM(competitor_market_share) * 100.0 /
    (SELECT total_addressable_market FROM markets WHERE venture_id = v.venture_id)) AS market_coverage_pct
FROM competitors c
JOIN ventures v ON c.venture_id = v.id
WHERE c.stage_id = 4
GROUP BY venture_id;
```

**Threshold**: ≥80%
**Alert**: If market_coverage < 80%, expand competitor search

---

### 2. Competitor Identification

**SQL** (proposed):
```sql
-- Count direct + indirect competitors
SELECT
  venture_id,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN competitor_type = 'direct' THEN 1 END) AS direct_count,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN competitor_type = 'indirect' THEN 1 END) AS indirect_count,
  COUNT(*) AS total_competitors
FROM competitors
WHERE stage_id = 4
GROUP BY venture_id;
```

**Threshold**: ≥5 total (≥3 direct, ≥2 indirect)
**Alert**: If total_competitors < 5, block Stage 5 progression

---

### 3. Differentiation Score

**SQL** (proposed):
```sql
-- Calculate differentiation score (USP strength + moat strength) / 2
SELECT
  venture_id,
  (usp_strength_score + moat_strength_score) / 2 AS differentiation_score
FROM market_positioning
WHERE stage_id = 4;
```

**Threshold**: ≥70
**Alert**: If differentiation_score < 70, flag for positioning review

**Scoring Components**:
- **USP Strength Score** (0-100):
  - 40 pts: Unique feature set (not offered by competitors)
  - 30 pts: Customer pain point addressed better than competitors
  - 30 pts: Clear articulation (validated with target users)
- **Moat Strength Score** (0-100):
  - 30 pts: Network effects potential
  - 25 pts: Proprietary data/technology
  - 25 pts: Brand recognition/trust
  - 20 pts: Barriers to entry (IP, regulatory, capital)

---

## Dashboard Visualizations (Proposed)

1. **Competitor Landscape Map**: Scatter plot (x: market share, y: feature parity) showing all competitors
2. **Feature Matrix Heatmap**: Competitors (rows) vs. Features (columns) with color-coded parity
3. **Differentiation Radar Chart**: Multi-axis chart showing USP strength across dimensions
4. **Moat Strength Breakdown**: Stacked bar chart of moat components (network effects, IP, brand, etc.)

## Known Gaps (from critique)

⚠️ **Missing Threshold Values**: Critique notes "Metrics defined but validation criteria unclear" (score: 3/5)

⚠️ **Missing Measurement Frequency**: No guidance on when to measure (per-venture, daily rollup, etc.)
