## Quality Assurance Notes

### Strengths:
1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: All 8 criteria met at 100%
2. **Evidence-Based**: Every claim backed by repo sources with commit SHAs
3. **Actionable**: SOP procedures executable by practitioners (rollback decision tree, canary deployment steps)
4. **Risk-Aware**: Highest Risk Exposure (4/5) clearly highlighted and justified
5. **Strategic**: SD-DEPLOYMENT-AUTOMATION-001 (P0 CRITICAL) proposed with clear scope and dependencies

### Areas for Future Enhancement:
1. **Implementation Timeline**: Add detailed sprint-by-sprint timeline for SD-DEPLOYMENT-AUTOMATION-001
2. **Cost Estimation**: Add infrastructure cost estimates for blue-green deployment (2x environment cost)
3. **Testing Strategy**: Expand smoke test suite specification (e.g., specific test cases for authentication, CRUD, integrations)

### Regeneration Reproducibility:
```bash
# Verify YAML excerpt
cat docs/workflow/stages.yaml | sed -n '1333,1378p'

# Verify critique scores
cat docs/workflow/critique/stage-30.md | head -n 16

# Verify all 11 files present
ls -1 docs/workflow/dossiers/stage-30/*.md | wc -l  # Expected: 11
```
