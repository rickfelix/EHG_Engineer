## Workflow Position

**Phase**: Ideation (final stage)
**Critical Path**: ✅ Yes (technical approval required before Planning phase)
**Blocking**: Stage 11 and all downstream stages

**Upstream Dependencies**:
- Stage 9: Resource Allocation & Capacity Planning (immediate)
- Stages 1-8: Indirect (inputs flow through Stage 9)

**Downstream Impact**:
- Stage 11: Strategic Naming & Brand Foundation (immediate)
- Stages 12-40: All downstream (blocked until technical approval)

## Recursion Pathways

### Outbound Recursion

**FROM Stage 10 TO Earlier Stages**:

```
Stage 10 (Technical Review Complete)
  ↓
Issue Detection: Blocking technical issues, timeline impact, cost increase, feasibility
  ↓
  ├─ BLOCKING ISSUES ≥ 1
  │   └─→ TECH-001 → Stage 8 (Re-decompose WBS with technical constraints)
  │       Severity: HIGH | Approval: Chairman required
  │
  ├─ TIMELINE IMPACT > 30%
  │   └─→ TECH-001 → Stage 7 (Adjust comprehensive planning timeline)
  │       Severity: HIGH | Approval: Chairman required
  │
  ├─ COST INCREASE > 25%
  │   └─→ TECH-001 → Stage 5 (Update financial model with accurate costs)
  │       Severity: HIGH | Approval: Chairman required
  │
  └─ FEASIBILITY < 0.5
      └─→ TECH-001 → Stage 3 (Re-validate solution with technical reality)
          Severity: CRITICAL | Approval: Auto-execute (Chairman notified post-execution)
```

### Inbound Recursion

**FROM Later Stages TO Stage 10**:

```
Stage 14: Development Preparation
  ↓
Environment setup reveals new technical issues
  ↓
TECH-001 (MEDIUM severity) → Stage 10
  └─ Reason: Need updated technical review with environment-specific constraints

Stage 22: Development Iteration (Build/Test/Learn)
  ↓
Implementation reveals architectural problems
  ↓
TECH-001 (HIGH severity) → Stage 10
  └─ Reason: Technical review needs update based on implementation learnings
```

**Evidence**: EHG_Engineer@6ef8cf4:docs/workflow/critique/stage-10.md:126-131 "Recursion Triggers That May RETURN TO This Stage"

---

## Loop Prevention

**Max Recursions**: 3 triggers from Stage 10 per venture

**Escalation After 3rd TECH-001**:
- Chairman must decide:
  - Simplify scope (remove technical blockers)
  - Kill venture (too technically complex for current capabilities)
  - Acquire expertise/tools to resolve blocks
  - Accept technical debt and proceed (with documented risks)

**Tracking**: Each TECH-001 event logs full technical review snapshot for trend analysis

**Evidence**: EHG_Engineer@6ef8cf4:docs/workflow/critique/stage-10.md:133-141 "Loop Prevention"

---

## Parallel Stage Relationships

**No parallel stages** - Stage 10 is sequential with exclusive technical review focus.

**Sequential Dependencies**:
- Stage 9 MUST complete before Stage 10 starts
- Stage 10 MUST complete (and pass exit gates) before Stage 11 starts

**Evidence**: EHG_Engineer@6ef8cf4:docs/workflow/stages.yaml:413-414 "depends_on: [9]"
