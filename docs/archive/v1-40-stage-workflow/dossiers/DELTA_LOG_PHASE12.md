- **Plan**: Generate Stages 37-40 in Phase 13 (final 4 stages)
- **Target**: Maintain 100/100 average, complete 100% milestone

### 2. **Verify Stage 40 Chairman Gate** 🚪
- **Hypothesis**: Stage 40 likely has final Chairman approval gate (pattern: Stages 21, 30, 40)
- **Research**: Confirm Chairman gate in Stage 40 YAML + critique

### 3. **Prepare Phase 14 Comprehensive Retrospective** 📊
- **Timing**: After Phase 13 (100% dossiers complete, 40/40 stages)
- **Scope**: Aggregate analysis of 40-stage corpus (quality trends, recursion taxonomy, agent/crew inventory, SD prioritization)
- **Deliverable**: Comprehensive retrospective document (expanded MIDPOINT_REVIEW.md format)

### 4. **Prepare Phase 15 Wave 1 Execution** 🔄
- **Context**: 3 SDs queued (METRICS-FRAMEWORK, RECURSION-ENGINE, CRITIQUE-TEMPLATE-UPDATE)
- **Action**: Create database records in `strategic_directives_v2` table (status=queued → draft)
- **Timing**: Begin LEAD approval immediately after Phase 13 completion

### 5. **Track Final EVA-Owned Stage Candidate** 🤖
- **Hypothesis**: 4/36 = 11.1% AI-ownership, projects to 4-5/40 = 10-12.5%
- **Candidates**: Stage 37-40 (check for 5/5 Automation + EVA ownership in critiques)
- **Research**: Note EVA ownership, automation scores in Stage 37-40 dossiers
