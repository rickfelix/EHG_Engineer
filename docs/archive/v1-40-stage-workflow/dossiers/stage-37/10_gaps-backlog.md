## Executive Summary

This document catalogs all identified gaps, limitations, and future enhancements for Stage 37: Strategic Risk Forecasting. Items are prioritized by impact and feasibility, with clear ownership assignments.

**Current State**: 2.9/5 (functional but needs optimization)
**Target State**: 4.5/5 (production-ready with automation)

**Evidence**: EHG_Engineer@6ef8cf4:docs/workflow/critique/stage-37.md:16 "Overall: 2.9"

---

## Critical Gaps (Blocking Production Readiness)

### GAP-37-001: Automation Level Below Target

**Description**: Stage 37 currently 0% automated (fully manual), target is 80% automation.

**Impact**: HIGH
- Chairman time: 15h/week (unsustainable at scale)
- Response time: Days (target: ≤24h for critical risks)
- Scalability: Cannot handle >5 concurrent ventures

**Evidence**: EHG_Engineer@6ef8cf4:docs/workflow/critique/stage-37.md:24 "Limited automation for manual processes"

**Root Cause**: No AI agents implemented for Risk Modeling (37.1), Impact Assessment (37.2), or Contingency Planning (37.3)

**Proposed Solution**: Implement RISK-FORECAST-001 through 004 (see 07_recursion-blueprint.md)

**Timeline**:
- RISK-FORECAST-001 (Risk Modeling automation): 10 weeks, $88k
- RISK-FORECAST-002 (Monitoring dashboard): 11 weeks, $108k
- RISK-FORECAST-003 (Adaptive strategies): 11 weeks, $107k
- RISK-FORECAST-004 (Auto-activation): 10 weeks, $100k
- **Total**: 42 weeks sequential (or 16 weeks parallel), $403k

**Owner**: Chairman (approval), AI Engineer + Data Scientist (implementation)

**Priority**: P0 (must-have for production)

**Dependencies**: None (foundational improvement)

**Success Criteria**:
- Chairman time reduced to 3h/week
- Response time for critical risks ≤1h (with automation)
- Automation rate ≥80% (measured by % of scenarios/plans generated by AI)

---

### GAP-37-002: Missing Rollback Procedures

**Description**: No defined process for reverting forecasts or deactivating contingency plans when errors detected.

**Impact**: MEDIUM-HIGH
- Incorrect forecasts may persist without correction
- Activated contingency plans may continue unnecessarily (wasting resources)
- No safety net for model failures

**Evidence**: EHG_Engineer@6ef8cf4:docs/workflow/critique/stage-37.md:25 "Unclear rollback procedures"

**Root Cause**: Rollback not considered in initial stage design

**Proposed Solution**: Define rollback decision tree and procedures in 05_professional-sop.md (already added)

**Rollback Trigger**: Forecast accuracy <50% for 2 consecutive quarters

**Rollback Actions**:
1. Suspend new forecasts, revert to previous quarter's forecast
2. Investigate forecast errors (root cause analysis)
3. Recalibrate models with updated data
4. Backtest revised forecast on historical data
5. Chairman approves redeployment

**Timeline**: 2 weeks (procedure documentation + system implementation)

**Budget**: $15k (engineering time)

**Owner**: Risk Analyst (procedure design), Backend Engineer (system implementation)

**Priority**: P0 (safety-critical)

**Dependencies**: GAP-37-001 (automation must be in place before rollback matters)

**Success Criteria**:
- Rollback procedure documented and approved
- Rollback can be executed within 1 week of trigger
- Test rollback with simulated forecast failure

---

### GAP-37-003: Data Flow Transformation Rules Undefined

**Description**: Input/output schemas defined, but transformation logic and validation rules missing.

**Impact**: MEDIUM
- Data quality issues may go undetected
- Agents may produce inconsistent outputs
- Debugging difficult without clear data contracts

**Evidence**: EHG_Engineer@6ef8cf4:docs/workflow/critique/stage-37.md:41-45 "Improve Data Flow: Data transformation rules"

**Root Cause**: Stage definition focused on inputs/outputs, not transformations

**Proposed Solution**: Document data schemas and transformations in new file `docs/workflow/dossiers/stage-37/12_data-schemas.md` (backlog item)

**Required Schemas**:
1. **Input Schemas** (from Stage 36):
   - Market intelligence report schema (JSON/YAML)
   - Risk indicator schema (time-series format)
   - Scenario model template schema
2. **Internal Schemas** (between agents):
   - Risk scenario schema (Agent 1 → Agent 2)
   - Impact assessment schema (Agent 2 → Agent 3)
   - Contingency plan schema (Agent 3 → Agent 4)
3. **Output Schemas** (to downstream stages):
   - Risk Forecast Report schema
   - Mitigation strategy schema
   - Contingency plan library schema

**Transformation Rules**:
- Market intelligence (unstructured text) → Risk indicators (structured metrics)
- Risk scenarios + probabilities → Expected value calculations
- Impact matrix + thresholds → Severity classifications

**Validation Rules**:
- Probabilities sum to 100% within each category (± 0.01 tolerance)
- Impact values non-negative
- Trigger conditions observable (no vague descriptions)

**Timeline**: 3 weeks (schema design + validation implementation)

**Budget**: $25k

**Owner**: Data Scientist (schema design), Backend Engineer (validation)

**Priority**: P1 (nice-to-have for initial production, critical for scaling)

**Dependencies**: GAP-37-001 (schemas most useful with automation)

**Success Criteria**:
- All schemas documented with examples
- Validation rules implemented in codebase
- Zero data quality issues in 3-month test period

---

## High-Priority Gaps (Improve Effectiveness)

### GAP-37-004: Metric Thresholds Not Specified

**Description**: Three metrics defined (forecast accuracy, risk preparedness, response time), but no target values or measurement frequency in stages.yaml.

**Impact**: MEDIUM
- Cannot objectively measure success/failure
- No automated quality gates
- Unclear when to trigger remediation

**Evidence**: EHG_Engineer@6ef8cf4:docs/workflow/critique/stage-37.md:38-39 "Missing: Threshold values, measurement frequency"

**Root Cause**: Stage definition intentionally high-level (details left to dossiers)

**Proposed Solution**: Thresholds already defined in 09_metrics-monitoring.md:
- Forecast accuracy: ≥75% (quarterly)
- Risk preparedness: 100% (monthly)
- Response time: ≤24h for critical, ≤1 week for high (per incident)

**Next Step**: Codify thresholds in `stage_37_config` table (see 08_configurability-matrix.md)

**Timeline**: 1 week (database setup + configuration entry)

**Budget**: $5k

**Owner**: Risk Analyst (threshold approval), Backend Engineer (implementation)

**Priority**: P1 (required for monitoring automation)

**Dependencies**: GAP-37-001 (thresholds most useful with automated monitoring)

**Success Criteria**:
- Thresholds stored in database
- Automated alerts trigger when thresholds crossed
- Dashboard displays target vs actual for all 3 metrics

---

### GAP-37-005: No Customer Validation Touchpoint

**Description**: Stage 37 is entirely internal (Chairman + team), with no external stakeholder input.

**Impact**: LOW-MEDIUM
- Risk forecasts may miss customer-visible risks
- Contingency plans may not address customer concerns
- No feedback loop on forecast relevance

**Evidence**: EHG_Engineer@6ef8cf4:docs/workflow/critique/stage-37.md:14 "No customer touchpoint" (score: 1/5)

**Root Cause**: Stage 37 is strategic planning (inherently internal), but could benefit from validation

**Proposed Solution**: Add optional stakeholder review checkpoint in Substage 37.3 (Contingency Planning)

**Mechanism**:
- **Frequency**: Quarterly for strategic plans, ad-hoc for critical risks
- **Participants**: Key customers, partners, advisors (external)
- **Format**: 1-hour review meeting
- **Focus**: High-impact contingency plans (e.g., "If competitor launches similar product, we will pivot to X")
- **Output**: Stakeholder feedback incorporated into plans

**Timeline**: 2 weeks (process design + pilot with 1 venture)

**Budget**: $10k (process design) + $5k/quarter (facilitation)

**Owner**: Strategic Planning Team

**Priority**: P2 (nice-to-have, improves relevance)

**Dependencies**: None (can implement independently)

**Success Criteria**:
- ≥1 stakeholder review conducted per quarter
- ≥3 actionable feedback items incorporated into plans
- Stakeholder satisfaction ≥4/5

---

### GAP-37-006: Tool Integration Not Specified

**Description**: No explicit tooling for risk modeling, dashboards, or monitoring.

**Impact**: MEDIUM
- Implementation teams must research and select tools
- Risk of tool fragmentation (different ventures use different tools)
- Integration complexity

**Evidence**: EHG_Engineer@6ef8cf4:docs/workflow/critique/stage-37.md:26 "Missing specific tool integrations"

**Root Cause**: Stage definition technology-agnostic by design

**Proposed Solution**: Define reference architecture in 06_agent-orchestration.md (already partially addressed)

**Recommended Tools**:
1. **Risk Modeling**: Python (pandas, scikit-learn, openai) or @RISK/Crystal Ball
2. **Dashboard**: React + D3.js + WebSockets (custom) or Grafana (off-the-shelf)
3. **Monitoring**: PostgreSQL + timescaledb (time-series) or InfluxDB
4. **Alerts**: SendGrid (email), Twilio (SMS), Slack API
5. **Workflow Orchestration**: Temporal.io (for contingency plan automation)

**Next Step**: Formalize tool selection in `docs/reference/stage-37-tech-stack.md` (backlog item)

**Timeline**: 1 week (research + documentation)

**Budget**: $8k (research + tool trials)

**Owner**: Backend Engineer (tool evaluation), Chairman (approval)

**Priority**: P1 (required before implementation)

**Dependencies**: GAP-37-001 (tool selection informs automation design)

**Success Criteria**:
- Tool recommendations documented with rationale
- All tools support required integrations (APIs, data export)
- Chairman approves tool selections

---

## Medium-Priority Gaps (Enhance Quality)

### GAP-37-007: Error Handling Not Explicit

**Description**: No defined error handling for failure scenarios (e.g., Stage 36 data unavailable, model calibration fails, resource constraints).

**Impact**: MEDIUM
- System may crash or produce invalid results
- Manual intervention required without clear guidance
- Poor user experience

**Evidence**: EHG_Engineer@6ef8cf4:docs/workflow/critique/stage-37.md:27 "No explicit error handling"

**Root Cause**: Error handling assumed to be implementation detail

**Proposed Solution**: Define error handling in 06_agent-orchestration.md (already partially addressed in "Error Handling" section)

**Error Scenarios Addressed**:
1. Data unavailable (Stage 36 outputs missing) → Pause, alert, request data, fallback to previous quarter
2. Model calibration fails (R² < 0.5) → Switch to qualitative method, wider confidence intervals
3. Dependency mapping incomplete → Flag for human review, proceed with direct impacts only
4. Resource constraints (budget >20%) → Prioritize Critical risks, defer High risks

**Next Step**: Implement error handling in automation codebase (part of GAP-37-001)

**Timeline**: Included in automation implementation (no additional time)

**Budget**: Included in $403k automation budget

**Owner**: Backend Engineer (implementation), Risk Analyst (fallback procedures)

**Priority**: P1 (required for robust automation)

**Dependencies**: GAP-37-001 (error handling only relevant with automation)

**Success Criteria**:
- All 4+ error scenarios have defined handling procedures
- System gracefully degrades (doesn't crash)
- Error logs captured for retrospective analysis

---

### GAP-37-008: Historical Data Collection Not Systematic

**Description**: No defined process for logging risk outcomes (for forecast accuracy measurement) or mitigation action effectiveness.

**Impact**: MEDIUM
- Cannot measure forecast accuracy (Metric 1)
- Cannot measure contingency plan effectiveness (Metric 5)
- No learning loop for improvement

**Root Cause**: Stage definition focuses on forward-looking forecasts, not retrospective analysis

**Proposed Solution**: Implement outcome tracking system

**Required Data Collection**:
1. **Risk Outcomes** (for each forecasted scenario):
   - Did risk occur? (Yes/No)
   - Actual impact (financial, operational, etc.)
   - Timestamp of occurrence
   - Root cause analysis (if occurred)
2. **Mitigation Actions** (for each action taken):
   - Action type, description, cost
   - Timestamp of action
   - Observed effect (impact reduction)

**Database Schema**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE risk_outcomes (
  outcome_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  risk_id INTEGER REFERENCES risk_forecasts(risk_id),
  occurred BOOLEAN NOT NULL,
  actual_impact NUMERIC,
  occurrence_timestamp TIMESTAMP,
  root_cause TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE mitigation_actions (
  action_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  risk_id INTEGER REFERENCES risk_forecasts(risk_id),
  action_type TEXT,
  action_description TEXT,
  action_cost NUMERIC,
  action_timestamp TIMESTAMP,
  impact_reduction_percentage NUMERIC
);
```

**Timeline**: 2 weeks (database schema + data entry UI)

**Budget**: $18k

**Owner**: Backend Engineer (schema), Risk Analyst (data entry process)

**Priority**: P1 (required for metrics)

**Dependencies**: GAP-37-001 (outcomes most useful with automated forecasting)

**Success Criteria**:
- All risk outcomes logged within 1 week of occurrence
- ≥90% of mitigation actions logged with effectiveness scores
- Forecast accuracy can be calculated automatically

---

### GAP-37-009: Cross-Venture Risk Aggregation Missing

**Description**: Stage 37 operates per-venture (isolated risk forecasts), with no system for identifying correlated or systemic risks across ventures.

**Impact**: MEDIUM
- May miss portfolio-level risks (e.g., regulatory change affecting multiple ventures)
- Inefficient resource allocation (duplicate contingency plans)
- No portfolio optimization

**Root Cause**: Stage definition is venture-centric by design (intentional)

**Proposed Solution**: Add cross-venture risk analysis as future enhancement (post-automation)

**Approach**:
1. **Correlation Analysis**: Identify scenarios that appear in multiple venture forecasts (e.g., "Economic recession")
2. **Systemic Risk Detection**: Flag risks with cascading effects across ventures
3. **Portfolio Contingency Plans**: Create shared contingency plans for correlated risks (cost savings)

**Example**: If 5 ventures forecast "AWS pricing increase" risk, create single contingency plan (multi-cloud strategy) shared across ventures.

**Timeline**: 8 weeks (after GAP-37-001 complete)

**Budget**: $70k

**Owner**: Strategic Planning Team (analysis), Data Scientist (correlation detection)

**Priority**: P3 (future enhancement, not critical for initial production)

**Dependencies**: GAP-37-001 (requires automated per-venture forecasting first)

**Success Criteria**:
- ≥3 correlated risks identified across ventures
- ≥1 shared contingency plan created (cost savings documented)

---

## Low-Priority Gaps (Future Enhancements)

### GAP-37-010: No Real-Time Risk Indicator Feeds

**Description**: Risk indicators pulled manually or on scheduled basis (daily/hourly), not real-time.

**Impact**: LOW
- Trigger detection latency (hours)
- Cannot respond to rapidly evolving risks (e.g., PR crisis)

**Proposed Solution**: Integrate real-time data feeds (e.g., Twitter API for sentiment, stock market API for financial risks)

**Timeline**: 6 weeks (after RISK-FORECAST-002 complete)

**Budget**: $55k + $10k/year (API subscriptions)

**Owner**: Backend Engineer

**Priority**: P3 (nice-to-have for high-frequency risks)

**Dependencies**: RISK-FORECAST-002 (requires monitoring dashboard)

---

### GAP-37-011: No Machine Learning for Scenario Generation

**Description**: Risk scenarios currently generated by LLM prompts or human judgment, not ML models trained on historical data.

**Impact**: LOW-MEDIUM
- Scenario quality depends on prompt engineering
- No continuous learning from outcomes

**Proposed Solution**: Train ML model on historical risk scenarios + outcomes

**Approach**:
1. Collect ≥500 historical risk scenarios with outcomes
2. Train supervised learning model (e.g., XGBoost) to predict risk occurrence
3. Use model to generate scenario probabilities (replace LLM for quantitative method)

**Timeline**: 12 weeks (data collection + model training + integration)

**Budget**: $95k

**Owner**: Data Scientist

**Priority**: P3 (optimization, not required for MVP)

**Dependencies**: GAP-37-008 (requires historical outcome data)

---

### GAP-37-012: No Predictive Trigger Alerts

**Description**: Triggers activate when condition met, not when condition predicted to meet soon (proactive vs reactive).

**Impact**: LOW
- Reactive response (trigger already crossed)
- Miss opportunity for preemptive action

**Proposed Solution**: Build predictive trigger system

**Example**: Instead of "Alert when forecast accuracy <50%", alert when "Forecast accuracy predicted to drop below 50% within 2 weeks based on trend".

**Timeline**: 8 weeks (after RISK-FORECAST-002 complete)

**Budget**: $65k

**Owner**: Data Scientist (predictive model), Backend Engineer (alert system)

**Priority**: P3 (optimization)

**Dependencies**: RISK-FORECAST-002 (requires monitoring + trend data)

## Gap-Tracking Metrics

### Coverage Metrics

| Metric | Current | Target | Gap |
|--------|---------|--------|-----|
| Automation Rate | 0% | 80% | 80% (GAP-37-001) |
| Metric Threshold Coverage | 0/3 | 3/3 | 3 metrics (GAP-37-004) |
| Data Schema Coverage | 0/9 | 9/9 | 9 schemas (GAP-37-003) |
| Error Scenario Coverage | 0/4+ | 4+ | 4+ scenarios (GAP-37-007) |
| Customer Touchpoints | 0 | 1 | 1 touchpoint (GAP-37-005) |

### Budget Summary

| Priority | # Gaps | Total Budget | Timeline |
|----------|--------|--------------|----------|
| P0 (Critical) | 3 | $431k | 42 weeks (sequential) or 16 weeks (parallel) |
| P1 (High) | 4 | $166k | 8 weeks (parallel with P0) |
| P2 (Medium) | 2 | $88k | 10 weeks (after P0) |
| P3 (Low) | 3 | $215k | 26 weeks (future) |
| **Total** | **12** | **$900k** | **48+ weeks** |

### Risk Assessment

**Biggest Risk**: GAP-37-001 (automation) is complex and expensive ($403k). If it fails or delivers poor quality, entire roadmap is at risk.

**Mitigation**:
- Incremental delivery (4 separate SDs, each delivering value)
- Pilot with 1 venture before rolling out globally
- Maintain manual fallback throughout transition
