# Stage 37: Strategic Risk Forecasting - Overview

## Executive Summary

**Stage 37: Strategic Risk Forecasting** is a Chairman-owned analytical stage focused on forecasting strategic risks and market changes before they impact venture execution. This stage builds upon market intelligence from Stage 36 (Competitive Intelligence Gathering) to create predictive models, quantify potential impacts, and establish contingency plans.

**Key Characteristics**:
- **Owner**: Chairman
- **Depends On**: Stage 36 (Competitive Intelligence Gathering)
- **Blocks**: Stage 38 (subsequent stages)
- **Progression Mode**: Manual → Assisted → Auto (suggested)
- **Current Score**: 2.9/5 (functional but needs optimization)

## Venture Selection Context

Strategic Risk Forecasting is critical for **all venture types** but has varying priority:

### High Priority Ventures
- **Strategic ventures** with significant market exposure
- **Infrastructure ventures** with cascading failure risks
- **Regulatory-sensitive ventures** (compliance risks)
- **High-investment ventures** requiring contingency reserves

### Medium Priority Ventures
- **Incremental improvement ventures** with limited scope
- **Internal tool ventures** with contained impact radius
- **Proof-of-concept ventures** in controlled environments

### Low Priority Ventures
- **Exploratory ventures** with minimal commitment
- **Deprecated feature removal** with low risk profile

## Three Substages

### 37.1 Risk Modeling
Build predictive models and define risk scenarios with calculated probabilities.

**Done When**:
- Models built
- Scenarios defined
- Probabilities calculated

### 37.2 Impact Assessment
Quantify potential impacts across dimensions (financial, operational, reputational).

**Done When**:
- Impacts quantified
- Dependencies mapped
- Thresholds set

### 37.3 Contingency Planning
Create actionable contingency plans with clear triggers and resource allocation.

**Done When**:
- Plans created
- Triggers defined
- Resources reserved

## Success Criteria

**Entry Gates**:
- Data sources connected
- Models calibrated

**Exit Gates**:
- Risks forecasted
- Strategies defined
- Plans activated

**Key Metrics**:
- Forecast accuracy (target: ≥75%)
- Risk preparedness (target: 100% of high/critical risks)
- Response time (target: ≤24 hours for critical risks)

## Current State Assessment

**Strengths**:
- Clear Chairman ownership
- Well-defined substage progression
- Explicit dependency on Stage 36
- Three measurable success metrics

**Critical Gaps** (from critique):
1. **Automation**: Currently manual, target 80% automation
2. **Data Flow**: Missing transformation and validation rules
3. **Rollback**: No defined rollback procedures
4. **Tool Integration**: No explicit tooling specified
5. **Customer Validation**: No feedback loop (score: 1/5)

## Integration Points

**Upstream** (Inputs from Stage 36):
- Market intelligence reports
- Competitive movement signals
- Industry trend data

**Downstream** (Outputs to Stage 38+):
- Risk forecasts with confidence intervals
- Mitigation strategies with cost/benefit analysis
- Contingency plans with activation triggers

**Cross-Stage Dependencies**:
- Stage 16 (Execution): Risk forecasts inform implementation decisions
- Stage 24 (Scale Operations): Scalability risks identified here
- Stage 36 (Competitive Intelligence): Primary data source

## Recursion Opportunities

This stage is a prime candidate for **RISK-FORECAST** family strategic directives:
- **RISK-FORECAST-001**: Automate risk modeling (address 80% automation gap)
- **RISK-FORECAST-002**: Build real-time risk monitoring dashboard
- **RISK-FORECAST-003**: Create adaptive mitigation strategy engine
- **RISK-FORECAST-004**: Implement contingency plan activation automation
