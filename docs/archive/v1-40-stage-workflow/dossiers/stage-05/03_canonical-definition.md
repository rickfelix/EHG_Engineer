## Substage Breakdown

### 5.1 Revenue Modeling

**Done When**:
- Revenue streams defined (e.g., subscriptions, one-time purchases, freemium)
- Growth projections created (month-over-month, year-over-year)

**Evidence**: EHG_Engineer@6ef8cf4:docs/workflow/stages.yaml:210-213 "5.1 Revenue Modeling"

---

### 5.2 Cost Structure

**Done When**:
- COGS estimated (cost of goods sold per unit/user)
- OpEx projected (operational expenses: salaries, marketing, infrastructure)
- CapEx planned (capital expenditures: initial development, equipment)

**Evidence**: EHG_Engineer@6ef8cf4:docs/workflow/stages.yaml:214-219 "5.2 Cost Structure"

---

### 5.3 Profitability Analysis

**Done When**:
- Break-even calculated (months/years to reach profitability)
- Margins projected (gross margin, net margin over time)
- ROI estimated (return on investment %, compared to 15% threshold)

**Evidence**: EHG_Engineer@6ef8cf4:docs/workflow/stages.yaml:220-225 "5.3 Profitability Analysis"

---

## Entry Gates

1. **Market positioning defined**: Stage 4 must complete competitive positioning and USP
2. **Pricing signals captured**: Stage 4 must validate pricing strategy with market research

**Evidence**: EHG_Engineer@6ef8cf4:docs/workflow/stages.yaml:201-203 "entry: Market positioning..."

---

## Exit Gates

1. **Financial model complete**: All revenue, cost, and profitability calculations validated
2. **Profitability validated**: ROI ≥ 15% (or Chairman override for strategic bets)
3. **Investment requirements defined**: Clear funding needs for execution phases

**Evidence**: EHG_Engineer@6ef8cf4:docs/workflow/stages.yaml:205-207 "exit: Financial model complete..."

---

## Metrics

1. **Model accuracy**: Variance between projected and actual results (measured post-launch)
2. **Revenue projections**: Monthly/yearly revenue forecasts for 3-5 years
3. **Margin forecasts**: Gross and net margin percentages over time

**Evidence**: EHG_Engineer@6ef8cf4:docs/workflow/stages.yaml:196-199 "metrics: Model accuracy..."

---

## Progression Mode

**Notes**: Manual → Assisted → Auto (suggested)

**Interpretation**:
- **Manual**: Initial implementation requires human financial analyst input
- **Assisted**: AI provides recommendations, templates, and validation
- **Auto**: Future state with automated financial modeling based on venture parameters

**Evidence**: EHG_Engineer@6ef8cf4:docs/workflow/stages.yaml:227 "progression_mode: Manual → Assisted"
