**Procedure**:
1. Research exit option categories:
   - Initial Public Offering (IPO)
   - Acquisition by strategic buyer
   - Acquisition by financial buyer (PE/VC)
   - Merger
   - Management buyout
2. Score each option on criteria:
   - Timeline to exit (years)

   - Revenue multiples (e.g., ARR for SaaS)
   - Profitability multiples (EBITDA, net income)
   - User/customer multiples (CAC, LTV, churn)
   - Market position metrics (market share, growth rate)
2. Select top 5-7 metrics for venture (based on business model)
3. Define current state baseline for each metric
4. Set target values for exit readiness (e.g., ARR ≥$10M, churn ≤5%)
5. Document in value driver framework

#### Step 2.2: Identify Growth Levers
**Objective**: Determine optimization opportunities to maximize valuation

**Procedure**:
1. Analyze each key metric from Step 2.1:

   - Estimate impact on valuation (e.g., +$2M enterprise value per 1% churn reduction)
   - Assess feasibility and cost of optimization
2. Prioritize growth levers by ROI (valuation impact / cost)
3. Create optimization roadmap (mapped to exit timeline from Step 1.3)
4. Assign ownership for each growth lever to executive team members

   - Copyrights (software, content)
   - Trade secrets
   - Proprietary processes
2. Assess IP protection gaps:
   - File patent applications for unprotected innovations
   - Register trademarks for brand assets
   - Implement trade secret protection protocols
3. Value IP portfolio (estimated contribution to enterprise value)
4. Document IP strategy in exit strategy workbook

**Evidence**: EHG_Engineer@6ef8cf4:docs/workflow/stages.yaml:587-588 "IP strategy set"

**Substage 13.2 Completion Criteria**: All 3 done_when conditions met (metrics, levers, IP)

### Phase 3: Substage 13.3 - Buyer Landscape

#### Step 3.1: List Potential Acquirers
**Objective**: Identify target buyer universe

**Procedure**:
1. Research potential acquirers by category:
   - **Strategic buyers**: Companies in same/adjacent industry
   - **Financial buyers**: Private equity firms, venture capital firms
   - **Competitors**: Direct competitors seeking consolidation

2. Create long list (20-30 potential acquirers)
3. Gather intelligence on each:
   - Recent M&A activity
   - Acquisition criteria (size, geography, capabilities)
   - Typical valuation multiples paid
4. Document in buyer landscape database

**Evidence**: EHG_Engineer@6ef8cf4:docs/workflow/stages.yaml:591-592 "done_when: Potential acquirers listed"

**Estimated Duration**: 2 weeks
**Owner**: CFO with investment banker (if engaged)
**Deliverable**: Buyer landscape database (20-30 entries)

#### Step 3.2: Assess Strategic Fit
**Objective**: Score alignment between venture and potential acquirers

**Procedure**:

   - Product/service complementarity (30% weight)
   - Customer base overlap (20% weight)
   - Geographic expansion opportunity (15% weight)
   - Technology/IP synergies (20% weight)
   - Cultural alignment (15% weight)
2. Score each potential acquirer on 1-5 scale for each criterion
3. Calculate weighted strategic fit score (max 5.0)
4. Rank acquirers by strategic fit score
5. Create shortlist (top 5-10 acquirers with score ≥3.5)

#### Step 3.3: Map Relationships
**Objective**: Identify existing relationships and connection opportunities

**Procedure**:
1. For each shortlist acquirer (from Step 3.2):
   - Map existing relationships (board members, investors, partners, customers)
   - Identify connection paths (1st degree, 2nd degree contacts)
   - Note relationship quality/strength (1-5 scale)
2. Create relationship map visual (network graph)
3. Develop relationship cultivation plan:
   - Identify gaps (no connections to key acquirers)
   - Plan outreach strategies (conferences, partnerships, board introductions)
   - Assign relationship owners to executive team members
4. Document in buyer relationship CRM

## Metrics Collection

### Metric 1: Exit Readiness Score
**Calculation**: Composite score based on:
- Value driver metric achievement (% of targets met)
- IP protection completeness (% of assets protected)
- Buyer relationship depth (avg relationship quality score)

**Target**: ≥80% for proceed decision (proposed threshold)

**Frequency**: Quarterly review (proposed)

**Evidence**: EHG_Engineer@6ef8cf4:docs/workflow/stages.yaml:564-565 "metrics: Exit readiness score"

**Gap Noted**: Threshold and frequency undefined in stages.yaml (critique:38-39)

### Metric 2: Valuation Potential
**Calculation**: Enterprise value estimate based on:
- Industry multiples × key metrics (e.g., 5x ARR)
- Comparable M&A transaction analysis
- DCF model (if applicable)

**Target**: ≥$XM enterprise value (Chairman-defined threshold)

**Frequency**: Semi-annual review (proposed)

**Evidence**: EHG_Engineer@6ef8cf4:docs/workflow/stages.yaml:565-566 "Valuation potential"

**Gap Noted**: Threshold value undefined (critique:38-39)

### Metric 3: Strategic Fit
**Calculation**: Average strategic fit score across shortlist acquirers (from Step 3.2)

**Target**: ≥3.5/5.0 average score (proposed threshold)

**Frequency**: Annual review or as market conditions change

**Evidence**: EHG_Engineer@6ef8cf4:docs/workflow/stages.yaml:566-567 "Strategic fit"

**Gap Noted**: Threshold undefined (critique:38-39)

## Rollback Procedures (Proposed)

### Rollback Trigger 1: Valuation Potential Below Threshold
**Condition**: Valuation potential <$XM (Chairman-defined minimum)
**Action**: Return to Stage 5 (Profitability) for business model optimization
**Rationale**: Exit strategy not viable without improved unit economics

**Evidence**: EHG_Engineer@6ef8cf4:docs/workflow/critique/stage-13.md:47-50 "Current: No rollback defined, Required: Clear"

### Rollback Trigger 2: No Viable Exit Path
**Condition**: All exit options scored <2.5/5.0 in Step 1.1
**Action**: Return to Stage 12 (Business Model Development) for pivot consideration
**Rationale**: Fundamental business model issues preventing exit

### Rollback Trigger 3: Strategic Fit Score Too Low
**Condition**: Average strategic fit <2.5/5.0 across all potential acquirers
**Action**: Return to Stage 6-7 (Market Validation) for repositioning
**Rationale**: Market positioning not aligned with buyer landscape

**Gap Noted**: Rollback procedures not defined in stages.yaml (critique:48-50)

## Automation Opportunities (Proposed)

### Current Automation Level: 20% (Manual Process)
**Automation Target**: 80% (per critique recommendation)

**Evidence**: EHG_Engineer@6ef8cf4:docs/workflow/critique/stage-13.md:32-34 "Target State: 80% automation"

### Automation Roadmap:
1. **Market data ingestion** (Step 1.1): Auto-fetch industry M&A data, valuation multiples
2. **Valuation modeling** (Step 2.1): Auto-calculate enterprise value based on metric inputs
3. **Buyer landscape mapping** (Step 3.1): Auto-populate buyer database from public M&A databases
4. **Strategic fit scoring** (Step 3.2): Auto-score acquirers based on criteria weightings
5. **Relationship tracking** (Step 3.3): CRM integration for buyer relationship management

### Manual Judgment Reserved For:
- Chairman exit path selection (Step 1.2)
- Growth lever prioritization (Step 2.2)
- Strategic fit criteria weighting (Step 3.2)
- Final exit strategy approval (Gate 1)

## Common Issues & Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: Chairman Availability Delays
**Symptom**: Stage 13 stalled waiting for Chairman decision
**Mitigation**: Implement assisted decision support (automation roadmap)
**Escalation**: CFO temporary decision authority for non-strategic items

### Issue 2: Insufficient Market Data
**Symptom**: Unable to complete Step 1.1 due to lack of comparable M&A data
**Mitigation**: Engage investment banker or M&A advisor for market intelligence
**Escalation**: Extend timeline for Step 1.1 by 1-2 weeks

### Issue 3: Low Strategic Fit Scores
**Symptom**: All potential acquirers scoring <3.0 in Step 3.2
**Root Cause**: Potential market positioning mismatch
**Mitigation**: Trigger rollback to Stage 6-7 for repositioning analysis
**Escalation**: Chairman decision on pivot vs. proceed with low fit
