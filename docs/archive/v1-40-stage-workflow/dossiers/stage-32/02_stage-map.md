## Upstream Dependencies

| Stage ID | Title | Relationship | Status |
|----------|-------|--------------|--------|
| 31 | MVP Launch | Direct dependency | ⚠️ Not Complete |

**Blocking Conditions**:
- Stage 31 must reach exit gate: "Users onboarded" (EHG_Engineer@468a959:docs/workflow/stages.yaml:1420)
- Sufficient customer data flowing for health monitoring
- Support ticket system operational

---

## Downstream Impact

| Stage ID | Title | Relationship | Impact |
|----------|-------|--------------|--------|
| 33 | Post-MVP Expansion | Direct dependent | Feeds customer insights for feature expansion |

**Value Delivery**:
- Customer health scores inform expansion priorities
- Retention data guides feature roadmap
- NPS feedback directs product improvements

---

## Parallel Execution Opportunities

**Independent Stages** (can run concurrently if Stage 31 complete):
- None identified - Sequential post-launch optimization

**Resource Considerations**:
- Customer success tools (CRM, health monitoring platforms)
- Support ticket data access
- Usage analytics infrastructure

---

## Critical Path Analysis

**On Critical Path**: ❌ No
**Reason**: Post-launch optimization; does not block Stage 33

**Parallel Track**: Growth & Retention (alongside expansion efforts)

**Skip Conditions**: None - Customer retention critical for sustainable growth

---

## Cross-Stage Data Flow

### Inputs (from Stage 31)
- **Customer data**: Onboarding records, user profiles
- **Usage metrics**: Feature adoption, engagement patterns
- **Support tickets**: Issues, feedback, churn signals

Evidence: EHG_Engineer@468a959:docs/workflow/stages.yaml:1431-1434 "inputs: Customer data, Usage metrics, Support tickets"

### Outputs (to Stage 33)
- **Success playbooks**: Best practices for customer engagement
- **Retention programs**: Automated interventions for at-risk customers
- **Health scores**: Predictive churn indicators

Evidence: EHG_Engineer@468a959:docs/workflow/stages.yaml:1435-1438 "outputs: Success playbooks, Retention programs, Health scores"

---

## Gate Progression

### Entry Gates (Prerequisites)
1. **Customers onboarded** - Sufficient user base for meaningful analysis
2. **Data flowing** - Analytics and support systems operational

Evidence: EHG_Engineer@468a959:docs/workflow/stages.yaml:1444-1446

### Exit Gates (Completion Criteria)
1. **Success system active** - CRM configured, playbooks deployed
2. **Retention improving** - Churn rate decreasing or stable
3. **NPS positive** - Customer satisfaction above threshold

Evidence: EHG_Engineer@468a959:docs/workflow/stages.yaml:1448-1450

## EVA Orchestration Context

**Ownership**: EVA-owned (Third AI-owned stage after 16, 24)

**Handoff Pattern**:
- Stage 31 (Manual/Human-led) → Stage 32 (EVA-owned) → Stage 33 (TBD)
- Chairman oversight for strategic retention decisions
- Automated health monitoring and alert generation

**Recursion Triggers** (Proposed in `07_recursion-blueprint.md`):
- RETENTION-001: Customer health score drops
- RETENTION-002: Retention rate below target
- RETENTION-003: NPS negative
- RETENTION-004: Success system active
