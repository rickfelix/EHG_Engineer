### Why This Was Archived

The 40-stage workflow was designed for team-based enterprise ventures. For the Solo AI Entrepreneur model (Chairman operating with AI assistance), a streamlined 25-stage "Venture Vision v2.0" workflow provides:

1. **Reduced cognitive overhead** - 40 stages too many for solo operation
2. **Faster validation cycles** - Condense early stages into focused gates
3. **Chairman Advisory soft gates** - AI provides guidance without hard blocks
4. **Platform-as-a-Factory model** - Parallel venture creation support
