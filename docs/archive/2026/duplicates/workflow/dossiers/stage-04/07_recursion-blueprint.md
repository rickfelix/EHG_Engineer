# Stage 4: Recursion Blueprint


## Metadata
- **Category**: Guide
- **Status**: Draft
- **Version**: 1.0.0
- **Author**: DOCMON
- **Last Updated**: 2026-01-21
- **Tags**: feature, sd, validation, workflow

**Status**: ⚠️ **MINIMAL RECURSION SUPPORT** (Header present, no details)

**Consistency Scan Result**: Y/N/N (Recursion section header exists but no trigger details)

**Evidence**: EHG_Engineer@6ef8cf4:docs/workflow/critique/stage-04.md:28

## Recursion Analysis

**Critique Contains**: Header "Recursive Workflow Behavior (SD-VENTURE-UNIFICATION-001)" on line 28

**Critique Does NOT Contain**:
- Recursion triggers table (unlike Stage 3 which has detailed table at lines 35-40)
- Recursion behavior description (unlike Stage 3 which has sections at lines 42-86)
- Loop prevention rules
- Chairman controls
- Performance requirements
- UI/UX implications

**Interpretation**: Stage 4 critique acknowledges the unified venture recursion system but does not define specific triggers or behavior. This suggests:
1. Recursion capability is recognized but not yet detailed
2. Stage 4 may be lower priority for recursion than critical gates like Stage 3
3. Future implementation work item to define recursion triggers

---

## Inbound Recursion Triggers

**Status**: ❌ **Not Defined**

**Potential Triggers** (theoretical, not implemented):
- **From Stage 5+**: If profitability forecasting reveals pricing assumptions invalid → Return to Stage 4 to re-evaluate market positioning and differentiation
- **From Stage 10+**: If technical review reveals competitive moat is not technically defensible → Return to Stage 4 to revise defense strategy

**Implementation Status**: ❌ Not implemented

---

## Outbound Recursion Triggers

**Status**: ❌ **Not Defined**

**Potential Triggers** (theoretical, not implemented):
- **To Stage 3**: If competitor analysis reveals market validation assumptions were wrong → Return to Stage 3 to re-validate problem-solution fit
- **To Stage 2**: If competitive landscape shows AI review missed key market trends → Return to Stage 2 for additional multi-model analysis

**Implementation Status**: ❌ Not implemented

---

## Loop Prevention

**Not applicable** (no recursion support defined)

---

## Future Considerations

**If recursion support added, should track**:
- `recursion_count_for_stage` (max 3 per venture)
- `trigger_data` (e.g., `{"competitor_moat_strength": "high", "our_moat_strength": "low"}`)
- `resolution_notes` (what changed in positioning/defense strategy)

**Recommended Recursion Triggers to Define**:
1. **FIN-002** (from Stage 5): If pricing strategy reveals competitive positioning invalid
2. **MKT-002** (from Stage 6+): If market research contradicts competitive analysis assumptions
3. **IP-001** (from Stage 10+): If IP review reveals moat is not defensible

## Comparison with Stage 3

| Feature | Stage 3 (Detailed) | Stage 4 (Minimal) |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Recursion section header | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| Inbound triggers table | ✅ 3 triggers (FIN-001, MKT-001, QUALITY-001) | ❌ None |
| Recursion behavior description | ✅ 4 steps documented | ❌ None |
| Loop prevention | ✅ Max 3 recursions | ❌ None |
| Chairman controls | ✅ Auto-execute vs. approval | ❌ None |
| Performance requirements | ✅ <100ms detection | ❌ None |
| UI/UX implications | ✅ Comparison view, history panel | ❌ None |

**Evidence**: Compare EHG_Engineer@6ef8cf4:docs/workflow/critique/stage-03.md:29-86 (detailed) vs. stage-04.md:28 (header only)
