## Executive Summary

**Stage ID**: 7
**Title**: Comprehensive Planning Suite
**Phase**: Ideation (Stages 1-10)
**Depends On**: Stage 6 (Risk Evaluation)
**Next Stage**: 8 (Problem Decomposition Engine)

Stage 7 develops comprehensive business and technical plans for venture execution. Creates business models, technical roadmaps, and resource allocation plans. This stage is a **RECURSION TARGET** - receives RESOURCE-001 and TIMELINE-001 triggers from Stage 8, and TECH-001 triggers from Stage 10 when later analysis reveals planning assumptions were incorrect.

**Maturity**: ⚠️ Not Implemented (planning automation and recursion engine incomplete)
**Automation Level**: Manual → Assisted → Auto (from stages.yaml notes)
**Critical Path**: Yes (planning outputs required for all downstream execution stages)

**Key Metrics**: Plan completeness, Timeline feasibility, Resource efficiency
**Primary Exit Gates**: Business plan approved, Technical roadmap set, Resources allocated

**Recursion Support**: ⚠️ **INBOUND ONLY** - Receives triggers from Stages 8, 10 (no outbound triggers defined yet)

**Evidence**: EHG_Engineer@6ef8cf4:docs/workflow/stages.yaml:274-319 "id: 7, title: Comprehensive Planning"
