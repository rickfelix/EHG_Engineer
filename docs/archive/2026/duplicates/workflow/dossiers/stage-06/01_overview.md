# Stage 6: Risk Evaluation — Operating Dossier


## Metadata
- **Category**: Guide
- **Status**: Draft

## Executive Summary

**Stage ID**: 6
**Title**: Risk Evaluation
**Phase**: Ideation (Stages 1-10)
**Depends On**: Stage 5 (Profitability Forecasting)
**Next Stage**: 7 (Strategic Fit Assessment)

Stage 6 conducts comprehensive risk assessment and mitigation strategy development. Identifies technical, market, and operational risks; scores probability and impact; develops mitigation plans and contingency strategies. This stage can trigger recursion back to Stage 5 when risk assessment uncovers hidden costs (e.g., compliance, insurance, legal costs).

**Maturity**: ⚠️ Not Implemented (risk analysis tools and automated risk matrix incomplete)
**Automation Level**: Manual → Assisted → Auto (from stages.yaml notes)
**Critical Path**: Yes (risk mitigation blocks downstream execution)

**Key Metrics**: Risk coverage, Mitigation effectiveness, Risk score
**Primary Exit Gates**: All risks identified, Mitigation plans approved, Risk tolerance defined

**Recursion Support**: ⚠️ **PROPOSED** - Triggers FIN-001 (to Stage 5) when hidden costs discovered (referenced in Stage 5 critique)
