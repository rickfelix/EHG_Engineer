# Legacy Dossier Reports — Migration Note

**Archived**: 2026-02-14
**Reason**: 40-stage model consolidated to 25-stage Vision v4.7

These files were generated during the original 40-stage dossier generation effort (2025-11-05/06).
They reference stages 26-40 which no longer exist in the 25-stage Vision v4.7 architecture.

## Files Archived
- `FINAL_SUMMARY_REPORT.md` — Claims "All 40 stages (100% complete)" with 440 files
- `MIDPOINT_REVIEW.md` — Mid-point retrospective from 40-stage era
- `PHASE-09-BATCH-SUMMARY.md` — Batch summary for accelerated phase
- `DELTA_LOG.md` — Master delta log
- `DELTA_LOG_PHASE4.md` through `DELTA_LOG_PHASE13.md` — Per-phase delta logs

## Why Archived (Not Deleted)
These files contain historical context about the dossier generation methodology
and scoring approach. They may be useful for reference but should not be treated
as current documentation.

## Current Architecture
- **25-stage Vision v4.7** is the canonical source
- See `docs/plans/eva-platform-architecture.md` Section 5
- Active dossiers: `docs/guides/workflow/dossiers/`
