# LEAD to PLAN Handoff: SDIP Implementation

**Date**: 2025-09-03
**From**: LEAD Agent
**To**: PLAN Agent
**Strategic Directive**: SD-2025-0903-SDIP
**Protocol Version**: LEO v4.1.2_database_first

---

## 1. Executive Summary (â‰¤200 tokens)

SDIP (Strategic Directive Initiation Protocol) transforms Chairman's raw feedback into validated Strategic Directives through a 6-step mandatory validation workflow. MVP+ scope includes all validation features: intent confirmation, strategic/tactical classification, synthesis with policy badges, clarifying questions, and client summaries. Critical mode analysis only. Integration with existing LEO dashboard required. 15-day implementation timeline.

## 2. Completeness Report

### âœ… Completed by LEAD:
- [x] Strategic Directive created in database (SD-2025-0903-SDIP)
- [x] Business objectives defined (5 clear objectives)
- [x] Success criteria established (5 measurable criteria)
- [x] Constraints identified (5 key constraints)
- [x] Timeline set (15 days total)
- [x] Priority assigned (HIGH)
- [x] Stakeholders identified

### ðŸ”„ Pending for PLAN:

## 3. Deliverables Manifest

### LEAD Deliverables (Complete):
1. **Strategic Directive SD-2025-0903-SDIP** - Created in strategic_directives_v2 table
2. **Database Architecture Guide** - `/docs/DATABASE_ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md`
3. **SDIP Schema** - `/database/schema/006_sdip_schema.sql`
4. **Backend Engines** - PACER, Critical Analyzer, Synthesis Generator
5. **Validation System** - Gate enforcer with mandatory validation

### Expected from PLAN:
1. Product Requirements Document (PRD)
2. Technical specifications
3. UI wireframes/mockups
4. API contract definitions
5. Testing strategy
6. Sub-agent coordination plan

## 4. Key Decisions & Rationale

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| **MVP+ Scope** | Full validation features required for quality control |
| **Critical Mode Only** | "Cold war judge" pattern ensures honest feedback |
| **PACER Backend-Only** | Captures data for future use without UI complexity |
| **6 Mandatory Gates** | Ensures consistency and completeness |
| **Step-Driven UI** | Progressive disclosure reduces cognitive load |
| **Database-First** | Aligns with LEO Protocol v4.1.2 requirements |
| **15-Day Timeline** | Aggressive but achievable with focused effort |

## 5. Known Issues & Risks

### Technical Risks:
1. **OpenAI Dependency** - Critical analyzer requires API availability
2. **Complex UI State** - 6-step validation with accordion interface
3. **Database Performance** - Multiple JSONB queries for synthesis
4. **Browser Compatibility** - Step-driven UI may have edge cases

### Process Risks:
1. **Scope Creep** - Chairman may request additional features
2. **Integration Complexity** - Must work with existing dashboard
3. **Validation Accuracy** - Intent extraction may need tuning

### Mitigation Strategies:
- Implement fallback for AI features
- Thorough testing of UI states
- Database indexing on JSONB fields
- Clear scope boundaries in PRD
