# CLI vs GUI Stage-by-Stage Gap Analysis

> **Purpose**: Compare the GUI venture workflow (EHG frontend) against the CLI venture workflow (EHG_Engineer EVA orchestrator) for each of the 25 lifecycle stages. Identify gaps, CLI superiorities, and minimum viable changes to make the CLI the authoritative engine (replacing the GUI).
>
> **Method**: Ground-truth analysis (actual code and screenshots, NOT vision docs) + multi-AI triangulation (OpenAI, AntiGravity/Gemini, Claude).

## Stage 1: Draft Idea

### CLI Implementation (Ground Truth)

**Template**: `lib/eva/stage-templates/stage-01.js`
**Type**: Passive validation (NO analysisSteps)

**Schema** (3 fields):
| Field | Type | Validation | Required |
|-------|------|------------|----------|
| `description` | string | minLength: 50 | Yes |
| `valueProp` | string | minLength: 20 | Yes |
| `targetMarket` | string | minLength: 10 | Yes |

**Processing**:
- `validate(data)`: Checks 3 fields meet minimum length constraints
- `computeDerived(data)`: No-op (returns data unchanged)
- No `analysisSteps` defined — template is purely passive
- Produces `idea_brief` artifact in `venture_artifacts` table

**Orchestrator flow** (`eva-orchestrator.js` → `processStage()`):
1. Load venture context from `ventures` table
2. Load chairman preferences
3. Execute template analysisSteps (empty for Stage 1)
4. Run stage gates (no kill gate at Stage 1)
5. Run reality gates (none at 1→2 boundary)
6. Run Devil's Advocate review (if configured)
7. Run Decision Filter Engine (cost, tech, score, patterns)
8. Persist artifacts
9. Conditionally advance to Stage 2

**Input source**: `venture_briefs` table from Stage 0 (Intelligent Venture Entry Engine)

**CLI Stage 0** (`lib/eva/stage-zero/`) provides rich upstream data:
- 3 entry paths: Competitor Teardown, Blueprint Browse, Discovery Mode
- 8 synthesis modules: problem-reframing, moat-architecture, archetypes, build-cost-estimation, time-horizon, chairman-constraints, cross-reference, portfolio-evaluation
- Additional: Counterfactual Engine, Stage-of-Death Predictor, Venture Nursery, Portfolio Allocation, Sensitivity Analysis

### GUI Implementation (Ground Truth)

**Sources**: Playwright screenshots (`stage-0-choose-path-desktop.png`, `stage-1-idea-form-desktop.png`, `workflow-stage-1-draft-idea-desktop.png`) + EHG frontend code (`src/components/stages/v2/Stage01DraftIdea.tsx`)

**GUI Stage 0 — "Choose Path"** (wizard step 0):
- 3 entry paths: Manual Idea Entry, Competitor-Based Cloning, Browse Blueprint Ideas
- Simple path selection UI — no synthesis, no analysis

**GUI Stage 1 — "Draft Your Venture Idea"** (wizard step 1):

| Field | Type | Validation | Required | CLI Equivalent |
|-------|------|------------|----------|----------------|
| Venture Name | text input | Required | Yes | None |
| Company | dropdown | Required | Yes | None |
| Description | textarea (2000 char limit) | ≥50 chars | Yes | `description` |
| Problem Statement | textarea | None | No | None |
| Target Market | text input | None | No | `targetMarket` |
| Category | dropdown | None | No | None |
| Key Assumptions | textarea (one per line) | None | No | None |
| Tags | tag input | ≥1 tag | Yes | None |
| Strategic Focus Areas | multi-select (8 options) | ≥1 | Yes | None |
| Venture Archetype | dropdown | None | No (optional) | None |
| Success Criteria | accordion | None | No (optional) | None |

**GUI-only capabilities**:
- "Enhance with AI" button — AI enrichment of the idea text
- "Start from AI-generated opportunities" — browse pre-generated venture ideas
- "Browse Opportunities" link
- Idea Completeness percentage indicator
- Real-time character counting with visual feedback
- Change detection (save button disabled until data changes)
- Multi-step wizard flow: Choose Path → Idea → Research → Review & Create
- "Save Draft" + "Next: Start Research" buttons

**Frontend architecture**: React + ShadcN UI, React Query for async state, `useVenture()` / `useUpdateVenture()` hooks, Supabase direct mutations.
