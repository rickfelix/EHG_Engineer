# EXEC Agent Role Clarification

## Important Distinction: EXEC Agent vs Coordination Tool

### EXEC Agent (The Role)
- **What it is**: One of the three primary LEO Protocol agents (LEAD, PLAN, EXEC)
- **Who performs it**: Claude or a human developer
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Receive PRD from PLAN Agent
  - Implement the technical solution
  - **Coordinate sub-agents** (using tools)
  - Validate implementation
  - Hand back to PLAN for verification

### EXEC Coordination Tool (The Tool)
- **What it is**: A tool/utility that helps EXEC coordinate sub-agents
- **Location**: `/lib/agents/exec-coordination-tool.js`
- **Purpose**: Automate the complex task of managing multiple sub-agents
- **Not**: A separate agent or role

## Architecture Clarification

```
LEO Protocol Agents (Roles):
├── LEAD Agent (Strategic Planning)
├── PLAN Agent (Technical Planning)
└── EXEC Agent (Implementation)
    │
    └── Uses Tools:
        ├── exec-coordination-tool.js (coordinates sub-agents)
        ├── boundary-check.js (validates scope)
        └── Other implementation tools

Sub-Agents (Specialized Tools):
├── Security Sub-Agent (security-sub-agent.js)
├── Performance Sub-Agent (performance-sub-agent.js)
├── Design Sub-Agent (design-sub-agent.js)
├── Database Sub-Agent (database-sub-agent.js)
├── Documentation Sub-Agent (documentation-sub-agent.js)
├── Cost Sub-Agent (cost-sub-agent.js)
└── Testing Sub-Agent (testing-sub-agent.js)
```

## How EXEC Agent Uses the Coordination Tool

1. **EXEC receives PRD from PLAN**
   ```bash
   # EXEC Agent starts implementation phase
   ```

2. **EXEC uses coordination tool to manage sub-agents**
   ```javascript
   // EXEC Agent's code:
   const coordinationTool = new EXECCoordinationTool();
   const results = await coordinationTool.coordinate(prdId);
   ```

3. **EXEC reviews and integrates results**
   - Fix critical issues found by sub-agents
   - Implement recommendations
   - Continue with main implementation

4. **EXEC includes sub-agent results in handback to PLAN**

## Common Misconceptions

❌ **Wrong**: "EXEC Orchestrator is a new agent"
✅ **Right**: EXEC Agent uses a coordination tool

❌ **Wrong**: "Sub-agents work independently"
✅ **Right**: EXEC Agent coordinates sub-agents using tools

❌ **Wrong**: "There are 4 main agents now"
✅ **Right**: Still 3 main agents (LEAD, PLAN, EXEC); EXEC just has better tools

## Summary

The EXEC Agent role remains unchanged in its core responsibilities. We've simply provided better tooling (`exec-coordination-tool.js`) to help EXEC efficiently coordinate the various sub-agents required by modern software development.

Think of it like a project manager (EXEC) who now has project management software (coordination tool) to better manage their team of specialists (sub-agents).
