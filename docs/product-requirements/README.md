# Product Requirements Documents (PRDs)

This directory contains Product Requirements Documents for strategic directives and features.

## Purpose

PRDs define:
- **Feature specifications**: What will be built
- **User stories**: Who needs it and why
- **Acceptance criteria**: Definition of done
- **Technical requirements**: How it will work
- **Success metrics**: How to measure success

## File Naming Convention

```
PRD-SD-{ID}.md
PRD-{FEATURE}-{VERSION}.md
```

**Examples**:
- `PRD-SD-DATA-INTEGRITY-001.md` - PRD for SD-DATA-INTEGRITY-001
- `PRD-VENTURE-MVP-v2.md` - Version 2 of venture MVP PRD

## PRD Structure

## PRD Lifecycle

1. **Draft**: Initial PRD creation by PLAN agent
2. **Review**: Validation gates and approval
3. **Approved**: Ready for EXEC implementation
4. **In Development**: EXEC implementing from PRD
5. **Complete**: Implementation finished and validated

## Validation Gates

Before PRD approval:
- [ ] All user stories mapped to requirements
- [ ] Technical approach validated
- [ ] Test strategy defined
- [ ] Database schema reviewed (if applicable)
- [ ] API specs complete (if applicable)
- [ ] Acceptance criteria clear and testable
- [ ] Dependencies identified

## PRD Database Storage

PRDs are also stored in the database (`product_requirements` table):
```sql
SELECT * FROM product_requirements
WHERE sd_id = 'SD-XXX-001';
```

## Creating PRDs

### Via Script (Recommended)
```bash
node scripts/create-prd-from-sd.js SD-XXX-001
```

### Manual Creation
1. Copy template from `/docs/templates/`
2. Fill in all sections
3. Submit for validation
4. Insert into database

## PRD Templates

Available templates:
- `prd-template-standard.md` - General features
- `prd-template-ui.md` - UI-focused features
- `prd-template-api.md` - API development
- `prd-template-database.md` - Database changes

## Relationship to SDs

Every PRD corresponds to a Strategic Directive:

| Document | Created By | Purpose |
|----------|------------|---------|
| Strategic Directive (SD) | LEAD | What to build and why (strategy) |
| Product Requirements (PRD) | PLAN | How to build it (tactics) |
