## 1. Executive Summary

EHG_Engineer is a clean, minimal implementation of the LEO Protocol v3.1.5 for strategic directive management. This platform provides the essential components needed to build other applications with proven strategic planning workflows, without the complexity and overhead of the full EHG platform.

The platform serves as a foundation for rapid application development with consistent strategic planning, enabling teams to leverage the LEO Protocol's multi-agent workflow (LEAD/PLAN/EXEC/HUMAN) and database-first architecture for building scalable applications.

### Key Benefits
- **Clean Foundation**: Minimal footprint with only essential LEO Protocol components
- **Proven Workflow**: Battle-tested strategic directive management from EHG platform
- **Database-First**: Supabase integration with PostgreSQL for reliable data management
- **Agent-Centric**: Built-in support for LEAD/PLAN/EXEC/HUMAN communication protocols
- **Extensible**: Foundation that can be extended for specific application needs

## 2. Strategic Context

### 2.1 Strategic Directive Alignment

- [x] Database connection and query scripts

#### Feature 4: Agent Communication Protocols
**Description**: Standardized communication templates and protocols for LEAD/PLAN/EXEC/HUMAN agent interactions.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [x] LEAD to PLAN handoff templates
- [x] PLAN to EXEC handoff templates
- [x] LEO Protocol v3.1.5 communication header format
- [x] Reference file requirements for all communications
- [x] Agent role-specific communication standards

#### Feature 5: Template System
**Description**: Comprehensive template system for creating strategic directives, epic execution sequences, and product requirements documents.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- [x] Epic execution sequence template with acceptance criteria
- [x] Product requirements document template
- [x] Agent communication templates
- [x] Quick-start scripts for template generation

### 3.2 User Stories
- As a LEAD agent, I want to create strategic directives using templates so that I can maintain consistency and completeness
- As a PLAN agent, I want to break down strategic directives into epic execution sequences so that I can enable tactical implementation
- As an EXEC agent, I want to update task status and generate verification evidence so that I can demonstrate completion
- As a HUMAN agent, I want to oversee the strategic planning process so that I can ensure proper governance and approval
