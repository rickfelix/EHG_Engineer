## 📊 Current Agent Configuration

### Always-Required (7 agents)
These agents MUST execute at their respective phases:

```javascript
const alwaysRequired = {
  LEAD_PRE_APPROVAL: ['RISK', 'VALIDATION', 'SECURITY'],
  PLAN_VERIFY: ['TESTING', 'GITHUB', 'DOCMON', 'STORIES'],
  LEAD_FINAL: ['RETRO']
};
```

### Conditional (7 agents)
These agents trigger based on keywords:

- **API** - Triggers on: API, REST, GraphQL, endpoint
- **DEPENDENCY** - Triggers on: npm, CVE, vulnerability, package
- **DATABASE** - Triggers on: database, migration, schema
- **DESIGN** - Triggers on: UI, component, design
- **PERFORMANCE** - Triggers on: performance, optimization
- **STORIES** - Triggers on: user story keywords
- **UAT** - Triggers on: UAT, acceptance testing

---

## 🔍 Monitoring Plan

### Week 1-2: Active Monitoring

**What to Watch:**

1. **Mandatory Agent Execution**
   - Monitor: Are all 6 mandatory agents executing at their phases?
   - Alert: If any mandatory agent fails to execute
   - Check: `sub_agent_execution_results` table

2. **API Agent Triggering**
   - Monitor: Does API agent trigger for API-related SDs?
   - Check: SDs with "API", "REST", "GraphQL" keywords
   - Expected: 80-90% accuracy

3. **DEPENDENCY Agent Triggering**
   - Monitor: Does DEPENDENCY agent trigger for package/CVE SDs?
   - Check: SDs with "npm", "vulnerability", "dependency" keywords
   - Expected: 85-95% accuracy

4. **COST Agent Smart Detection**
   - Monitor: Does COST agent trigger for infrastructure SDs?
   - Check: SDs with "migration", "scaling", "Lambda" keywords
   - Expected: 90-95% accuracy

5. **False Positives**
   - Monitor: Are agents triggering when they shouldn't?
   - Adjust: Keyword thresholds if >20% false positives

### Key Metrics to Track

```sql
-- Daily agent execution count
SELECT
  sub_agent_code,
  COUNT(*) as executions,
  SUM(CASE WHEN verdict = 'PASS' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as passes,
  SUM(CASE WHEN verdict = 'FAIL' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as fails
FROM sub_agent_execution_results
WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
GROUP BY sub_agent_code
ORDER BY executions DESC;

-- Mandatory agent coverage
SELECT
  sd.id,
  sd.status,
  (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT sub_agent_code)
   FROM sub_agent_execution_results
   WHERE sd_id = sd.id
   AND sub_agent_code IN ('VALIDATION', 'SECURITY', 'DOCMON', 'STORIES', 'TESTING', 'GITHUB')
  ) as mandatory_agents_executed
FROM strategic_directives_v2 sd
WHERE sd.updated_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
ORDER BY sd.updated_at DESC
LIMIT 20;

-- New agent performance
SELECT
  sub_agent_code,
  AVG(confidence_score) as avg_confidence,
  COUNT(*) as total_executions,
  verdict
FROM sub_agent_execution_results
WHERE sub_agent_code IN ('API', 'DEPENDENCY')
AND created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY sub_agent_code, verdict;
```

### Alert Thresholds

| Metric | Threshold | Action |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Mandatory agent execution | <100% | Investigate immediately |
| API agent accuracy | <70% | Review keyword matching |
| DEPENDENCY agent accuracy | <80% | Review keyword matching |
| COST agent false positives | >20% | Adjust infrastructure keywords |
| Agent execution time | >5 minutes | Performance optimization needed |

## 🎯 Expected Impact

### Coverage Improvements
- **Security Reviews:** 70% → 100% (+30%)
- **Documentation:** 60% → 100% (+40%)
- **User Story Context:** 50% → 100% (+50%)
- **API Design Review:** 0% → 80%* (+80%)
- **Dependency Scanning:** 0% → 90%* (+90%)
- **Cost Analysis (infra):** 40% → 95%* (+55%)

_* Conditional based on keyword matching_

### Time Savings
- **Per SD:** ~2.5 hours saved on average
  - Manual COST selection: -5 min
  - Security catch-up: -15 min
  - Documentation writing: -30 min
  - Duplicate work prevention: -2 hours

- **Per Month (50 SDs):** ~125 hours saved
- **Per Year (600 SDs):** ~1,500 hours saved

## 🚨 Known Limitations

### Phase 4 Not Implemented (Optional)
- **Semantic Search:** Not yet implemented
- **Impact:** Current keyword matching has ~20-30% false positives
- **Mitigation:** Monitor and adjust keywords manually
- **Future:** Phase 4 can reduce false positives to <10%

### Manual Testing
- **Unit Tests:** Not yet executed
- **Integration Tests:** Not yet executed
- **Mitigation:** Relying on production monitoring
- **Future:** Execute full test suite after 1-2 weeks

### Documentation Generation
- **DOCMON Agent:** Enforced but not yet integrated with handoff blocking
- **Impact:** Documentation may still be generated manually
- **Mitigation:** Phase 5.3 will add handoff blocking
- **Workaround:** Monitor documentation coverage manually

## 📝 Next Steps

### Immediate (This Week)
1. **Monitor agent execution** daily for first 3 days
2. **Review sub_agent_execution_results** table for patterns
3. **Document any issues** in GitHub issues
4. **Adjust keywords** if false positives >20%

### Short-Term (Next 2 Weeks)
5. **Execute unit tests** from test plan
6. **Execute integration tests** from test plan
7. **Update handoff system** (Phase 5.3) to block on mandatory agents
8. **Gather user feedback** on agent accuracy

### Long-Term (Future)
9. **Consider Phase 4** (semantic search) if false positives remain high
10. **Add dashboard visualizations** for agent metrics
11. **Automate E2E testing** for orchestration
12. **Performance benchmarking** for agent execution times

## 📞 Support & Issues

### If Something Goes Wrong

1. **Agent Not Triggering:**
   ```bash
   # Check if agent exists in database
   node -e "
   import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';
   // ... check leo_sub_agents table
   "

   # Check keyword matches
   # Review context-aware-sub-agent-selector.js
   ```

2. **Agent Failing to Execute:**
   ```bash
   # Execute agent manually
   node lib/sub-agent-executor.js <AGENT-CODE> <SD-ID>

   # Check error logs in sub_agent_execution_results
   ```

3. **False Positives:**
   - Review keyword configuration in `lib/context-aware-sub-agent-selector.js`
   - Adjust minMatches threshold
   - Add exclusion patterns

4. **Roll Back (Emergency):**
   ```sql
   -- Remove new agents from database
   DELETE FROM leo_sub_agent_triggers WHERE sub_agent_id IN (
     SELECT id FROM leo_sub_agents WHERE code IN ('API', 'DEPENDENCY')
   );

   DELETE FROM leo_sub_agents WHERE code IN ('API', 'DEPENDENCY');

   -- Revert code changes
   git revert HEAD~3  -- Reverts last 3 commits
   ```
