# LEO Protocol Enhancements - Applied Successfully

**Date Applied**: 2025-10-10
**Target Database**: EHG_Engineer (dedlbzhpgkmetvhbkyzq.supabase.co)
**Test Case**: SD-AGENT-MIGRATION-001

## ✅ All 7 Enhancements Applied

### Enhancement #1: Scope-to-Deliverables Validation
**Status**: ✅ Applied
**Database Objects Created**:
- Table: `sd_scope_deliverables`
- Function: `check_deliverables_complete(sd_id)`
- Trigger: `auto_mark_deliverable_verified`

**Effectiveness**: ✅ **WOULD HAVE CAUGHT**
- SD-AGENT-MIGRATION-001 had 0 deliverables tracked
- 4 UI features promised (department filter, performance filter, sort controls, collapsible panel)
- Only 1 feature implemented
- **Prevention**: Blocks SD completion if deliverables not marked as complete

---

### Enhancement #2: Retrospective Quality Enforcement
**Status**: ✅ Applied
**Database Objects Created**:
- Columns: `quality_score`, `quality_issues`, `auto_generated` (on `retrospectives` table)
- Function: `validate_retrospective_quality(retro_id)` - Returns score 0-100
- Function: `check_retrospective_quality_for_sd(sd_id)`
- Trigger: `auto_validate_retrospective_quality`

**Scoring System** (Threshold: 70/100):
- What Went Well: 20 points (need ≥5 items, penalized for generic statements)
- Key Learnings: 30 points (need ≥5 items, >20 chars each)
- Action Items: 20 points (need ≥3 items)
- Improvement Areas: 20 points (need ≥3 items, no dismissive statements)
- Specificity Bonus: 10 points (mentions metrics, file names, technologies)

**Effectiveness**: ✅ **WOULD HAVE CAUGHT**
- SD-AGENT-MIGRATION-001 retrospective was generic ("SD completed successfully")
- **Prevention**: Blocks LEAD approval if quality score < 70

---

### Enhancement #3: PRD Completeness Validation
**Status**: ✅ Applied
**Database Objects Created**:
- Function: `validate_prd_completeness(prd_id)` - Returns score 0-100
- Function: `check_prd_for_exec_handoff(sd_id)`
- Trigger: `validate_prd_status_change` (blocks incomplete PRDs)

**Scoring System** (Threshold: 70/100):
- Objectives: 25 points (need >50 chars, not 'N/A')
- Acceptance Criteria: 30 points (need ≥3 items, not 'N/A')
- Scope: 15 points (need >100 chars)
- Test Plan: 15 points (need >50 chars)
- Technical Requirements: 15 points (bonus)

**Effectiveness**: ✅ **WOULD HAVE CAUGHT**
- SD-AGENT-MIGRATION-001 had PRD with `objectives='N/A'`, `acceptance_criteria='N/A'`
- **Prevention**: Blocks PLAN→EXEC handoff if PRD score < 70

---

### Enhancement #4: Handoff Enforcement Triggers
**Status**: ✅ Applied
**Database Objects Created**:
- Function: `enforce_handoff_on_phase_transition()` - DATABASE ERROR if missing handoff
- Function: `validate_handoff_completeness(handoff_id)` - Checks 7 elements
- Function: `auto_validate_handoff()` - Blocks acceptance if incomplete
- Function: `get_sd_handoff_status(sd_id)` - Summary for dashboard
- Trigger: `enforce_handoff_trigger` (on `strategic_directives_v2`)
- Trigger: `validate_handoff_trigger` (on `sd_phase_handoffs`)

**7 Mandatory Handoff Elements**:
1. Executive Summary (>50 chars)
2. Completeness Report
3. Deliverables Manifest
4. Key Decisions & Rationale
5. Known Issues & Risks
6. Resource Utilization
7. Action Items for Receiver

**Effectiveness**: ✅ **WOULD HAVE CAUGHT**
- SD-AGENT-MIGRATION-001 had ZERO handoffs recorded
- **Prevention**: Raises PostgreSQL exception if phase transition attempted without handoff within last 24 hours

---

### Enhancement #5: Sub-Agent Verification Gates
**Status**: ✅ Applied
**Database Objects Created**:
- Function: `check_required_sub_agents(sd_id)` - Scope-based agent detection
- Function: `get_subagent_recommendations(sd_id)` - CLI commands to run

**Always Required**:
- QA Engineering Director (TESTING)
- Continuous Improvement Coach (RETRO - retrospective)

**Conditionally Required** (keyword-based):
- Database Architect - if scope mentions: database, migration, schema, table
- Design Agent - if scope mentions: UI, component, design, interface, page
- Security Architect - if scope mentions: auth, security, permission, RLS
- Performance Lead - if scope mentions: performance, optimization, OR priority ≥80
- Systems Analyst - if scope mentions: integration, existing, refactor

**Effectiveness**: ✅ **WOULD HAVE CAUGHT**
- SD-AGENT-MIGRATION-001 had ZERO sub-agent verifications
- Scope included "database migration", "UI features" → Database Architect + Design Agent required
- **Prevention**: Blocks PLAN→LEAD handoff if `missing_count > 0`

---

### Enhancement #6: User Story E2E Validation Gate
**Status**: ✅ Applied
**Database Objects Created**:
- Columns (on `user_stories` table):
  - `e2e_test_path` - Path to Playwright test file
  - `e2e_test_status` - not_created | created | passing | failing | skipped
  - `e2e_test_last_run` - Timestamp of last E2E test run
  - `e2e_test_evidence` - URL to screenshot/video/report
  - `e2e_test_failure_reason` - Error details
  - `validation_status` - pending | in_progress | validated | failed | skipped
- Function: `validate_user_stories_complete(sd_id)` - Checks all stories have passing E2E tests
- Function: `check_stories_for_lead_handoff(sd_id)` - Blocks if stories exist but not validated
- Function: `get_e2e_test_commands(sd_id)` - Returns Playwright commands
- Trigger: `auto_validate_story_trigger` - Auto-validates when E2E test passes

**Effectiveness**: ✅ **WOULD HAVE CAUGHT**
- SD-AGENT-MIGRATION-001 had 5 user stories with `validation_status='NO'`
- **Test Results**: 0/5 stories validated (0% validation rate, need 100%)
- **Prevention**: Blocks PLAN→LEAD handoff unless `validation_rate = 100%`

---

### Enhancement #7: Progress Calculation Enforcement
**Status**: ✅ Applied
**Database Objects Created**:
- Function: `calculate_sd_progress(sd_id)` - Dynamic calculation (0-100%)
- Function: `get_progress_breakdown(sd_id)` - Detailed debugging info
- Function: `enforce_progress_on_completion()` - Blocks completion if < 100%
- Function: `auto_calculate_progress()` - Auto-updates on any SD change
- Trigger: `enforce_progress_trigger` (on `strategic_directives_v2.status`)
- Trigger: `auto_calculate_progress_trigger` (on any SD update)

**Progress Calculation Formula**:
- LEAD Initial Approval: 20% (status in 'active', 'in_progress', 'pending_approval', 'completed')
- PLAN PRD Creation: 20% (PRD exists with status 'approved' or 'in_progress')
- EXEC Implementation: 30% (all required deliverables marked 'completed')
- PLAN Verification: 15% (all user stories validated + all required sub-agents verified)
- LEAD Final Approval: 15% (retrospective quality ≥70 + ≥3 handoffs accepted)

**Effectiveness**: ✅ **WOULD HAVE CAUGHT**
- SD-AGENT-MIGRATION-001 had `progress_percentage = undefined` but status = 'completed'
- **Prevention**: Raises PostgreSQL exception with detailed breakdown if attempting to mark complete when progress < 100%

## 🚀 How to Use

### For LEAD Agent:
```bash
# Check if SD is ready for approval
node scripts/auto-trigger-subagents.mjs SD-XXX

# Verify retrospective quality
SELECT check_retrospective_quality_for_sd('SD-XXX');
```

### For PLAN Agent:
```bash
# Validate PRD before EXEC handoff
SELECT check_prd_for_exec_handoff('SD-XXX');

# Check user story validation status
SELECT validate_user_stories_complete('SD-XXX');

# Generate E2E test commands
SELECT get_e2e_test_commands('SD-XXX');
```

### For EXEC Agent:
```bash
# Extract deliverables from SD scope
node scripts/extract-scope-deliverables.mjs SD-XXX

# Mark deliverables as complete
UPDATE sd_scope_deliverables
SET completion_status = 'completed',
    completion_evidence = 'Implemented in commit abc123'
WHERE sd_id = 'SD-XXX' AND deliverable_name = 'Department Filter UI';
```

### For All Agents:
```bash
# Check overall progress
SELECT get_progress_breakdown('SD-XXX');

# Verify all gates before marking complete
SELECT calculate_sd_progress('SD-XXX'); -- Must return 100
```

## 🎯 Impact on SD-AGENT-MIGRATION-001

**Before Enhancements**:
- ❌ 3/4 UI features missing
- ❌ Progress = undefined
- ❌ Generic retrospective
- ❌ Zero handoffs
- ❌ Zero sub-agent verifications
- ❌ 5 user stories unvalidated
- ❌ PRD with "N/A" fields

**After Enhancements** (if applied retroactively):
- ✅ Cannot mark complete without 4 deliverables verified
- ✅ Progress auto-calculated to ~30% (only LEAD + PLAN phases complete)
- ✅ Cannot approve with low-quality retrospective
- ✅ DATABASE ERROR on phase transition without handoffs
- ✅ Cannot proceed to LEAD without QA Director + Design Agent + Database Architect
- ✅ Cannot approve with 0% user story validation
- ✅ Cannot mark complete with progress < 100%

**Result**: SD-AGENT-MIGRATION-001 would have been **BLOCKED at multiple gates** instead of marked complete incorrectly.
