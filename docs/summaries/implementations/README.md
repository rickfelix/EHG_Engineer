# Implementation Summaries

This directory contains completion summaries and status reports for completed implementations.

## Purpose

Implementation summaries document:
- **Completion status**: What was accomplished
- **Test results**: Validation and QA outcomes
- **Deployment info**: Release and rollout details
- **Lessons learned**: Retrospective insights

## File Types

### Completion Summaries
```
SD-{ID}_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md
{FEATURE}_COMPLETE.md
```

Documents fully completed implementations:
- Final deliverables
- Test coverage achieved
- Known limitations
- Post-deployment notes

### Implementation Status
```
SD-{ID}-IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS.md
{FEATURE}_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md
```

Tracks implementation progress:
- Current phase
- Completed user stories
- Remaining work
- Timeline and milestones

### System-Wide Status
```
{SYSTEM}_COMPLETE.md
{MIGRATION}_COMPLETE.md
```

Large-scale completions:
- Database migrations
- Infrastructure changes
- Protocol enhancements
- System consolidations

```markdown
# [Implementation Title] - Completion Summary

**Status**: [Complete/In Progress]
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**SD/PRD**: [Related IDs]

## Summary
[Brief overview of what was accomplished]

## Deliverables
- [x] Deliverable 1
- [x] Deliverable 2

## Test Results
- Unit tests: [X passed / Y total]
- E2E tests: [X passed / Y total]

## Lifecycle

1. **In Progress**: Status files updated during implementation
2. **Complete**: Summary created upon completion
3. **Archive**: Old summaries moved to `/docs/archive/` after 6 months
