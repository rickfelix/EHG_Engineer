## üß† Intelligence Analysis Capabilities

### 1. **Decision Effectiveness Analysis**

**LEAD Decision Intelligence:**
- Tracks which types of strategic decisions lead to successful outcomes
- Analyzes correlation between confidence levels and actual success
- Identifies patterns in successful vs. failed strategic assessments
- Learns optimal decision criteria for different project types

```sql
-- Example: Analyze LEAD decision effectiveness
SELECT
    lead_decision,
    AVG(CASE WHEN business_outcome = 'SUCCESS' THEN 1.0 ELSE 0.0 END) as success_rate,
    AVG(lead_confidence) as avg_confidence,
    COUNT(*) as decision_count
FROM agent_learning_outcomes
GROUP BY lead_decision;
```

**PLAN Technical Prediction:**
- Compares predicted complexity vs. actual complexity
- Tracks accuracy of technical feasibility assessments
- Learns which risk factors actually materialize
- Improves complexity scoring over time

```sql
-- Example: PLAN prediction accuracy
SELECT
    plan_complexity_score,
    AVG(exec_actual_complexity) as actual_avg_complexity,
    AVG(exec_actual_complexity - plan_complexity_score) as prediction_error
FROM agent_learning_outcomes
WHERE exec_actual_complexity IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY plan_complexity_score;
```

### 2. **Pattern Recognition & Learning**

**Success Pattern Analysis:**
```sql
-- Identify what makes projects successful
SELECT
    success_factors,
    COUNT(*) as occurrences,
    AVG(CASE WHEN business_outcome = 'SUCCESS' THEN 1.0 ELSE 0.0 END) as success_rate
FROM agent_learning_outcomes,
UNNEST(success_factors) as success_factor
GROUP BY success_factor
ORDER BY success_rate DESC;
```

**Complexity Factor Impact:**
```sql
-- Which complexity factors cause the most problems
SELECT
    complexity_factor,
    AVG(exec_actual_complexity - plan_complexity_score) as complexity_underestimate,
    AVG(CASE WHEN business_outcome IN ('FAILURE', 'PARTIAL_SUCCESS') THEN 1.0 ELSE 0.0 END) as problem_rate
FROM agent_learning_outcomes,
UNNEST(complexity_factors) as complexity_factor
GROUP BY complexity_factor
ORDER BY problem_rate DESC;
```

### 3. **Predictive Intelligence**

**Project Success Probability:**
Based on early indicators, predict likely outcomes:

```javascript
// Example intelligence query
const projectIntelligence = await intelligenceEngine.analyzeProject({
    projectTags: ['dashboard', 'real-time', 'user-facing'],
    leadDecision: 'APPROVE',
    leadConfidence: 85,
    planComplexity: 6,
    planRisk: 'MEDIUM'
});

// Returns:
// {
//   successProbability: 0.78,
//   riskFactors: ['real-time complexity', 'user-facing requirements'],
//   recommendations: ['increase testing focus', 'plan for user feedback'],
//   similarProjects: [...],
//   estimatedTimeline: '4-6 weeks'
// }
```
