## Risk Assessment Sub-Agent v1.0.0

**BMAD Enhancement**: Multi-domain risk assessment for Strategic Directives.

### Overview
Evaluates Strategic Directives across 6 risk domains to enable risk-informed decision making and prevent 4-6 hours of rework per SD.

---

## Risk Domains Assessed

### 1. Technical Complexity
- Code complexity and refactoring needs
- Technical debt implications
- Architecture changes required
- Integration with existing systems

### 2. Security Risk
- Authentication and authorization requirements
- Data exposure vulnerabilities
- RLS policy design complexity
- Security best practices adherence

### 3. Performance Risk
- Query optimization requirements
- Caching strategy needs
- Scaling concerns
- Database indexing impacts

### 4. Integration Risk
- Third-party API dependencies
- Service dependency reliability
- External system availability
- API versioning concerns

### 5. Data Migration Risk
- Schema change complexity
- Data integrity requirements
- Rollback complexity
- Migration testing needs

### 6. UI/UX Risk
- Component complexity
- Accessibility requirements
- Responsive design challenges
- User experience impact

## Risk Scoring Methodology

**Scale**: 1-10 per domain
- **1-3**: LOW - Minimal risk, standard implementation
- **4-6**: MEDIUM - Moderate risk, requires attention
- **7-8**: HIGH - Significant risk, needs mitigation plan
- **9-10**: CRITICAL - Severe risk, may block approval

**Overall Risk Level**: Calculated from domain scores
- **LOW**: All domains ≤ 4
- **MEDIUM**: Any domain 5-6, none > 6
- **HIGH**: Any domain 7-8, none > 8
- **CRITICAL**: Any domain 9-10

## Output Format

**Risk Assessment Report**:
```
{
  "overall_risk": "MEDIUM",
  "domain_scores": {
    "technical_complexity": 5,
    "security_risk": 6,
    "performance_risk": 3,
    "integration_risk": 4,
    "data_migration_risk": 7,
    "ui_ux_risk": 2
  },
  "critical_issues": [
    "Data migration requires complex rollback strategy"
  ],
  "warnings": [
    "Security: RLS policies need careful design",
    "Performance: Consider caching for frequent queries"
  ],
  "mitigation_recommendations": [
    "Create detailed migration rollback plan",
    "Review RLS policies with security sub-agent",
    "Add performance monitoring for critical queries"
  ]
}
```

## Activation

**LEAD Pre-Approval**: All Strategic Directives
- Run risk assessment before LEAD approval
- Include risk report in LEAD→PLAN handoff

**PLAN PRD Creation**: Complex SDs
- Re-assess risk after PRD requirements defined
- Update mitigation strategies

---

## Blocking Criteria

**HIGH Risk**: Requires documented mitigation plan
**CRITICAL Risk**: Blocks approval until risk reduced or comprehensive mitigation plan approved

---

## Integration with Issue Patterns

**Leverages**:
- Security issue patterns (1 pattern)
- Performance issue patterns (1 pattern)
- Database migration patterns (1 pattern)
- Build/deployment patterns (3 patterns)

**Prevention**: Early risk detection prevents 4-6 hours rework per SD (BMAD metrics)

---

## Capabilities

1. Multi-domain risk scoring (6 domains, 1-10 scale)
2. Overall risk level calculation (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH/CRITICAL)
3. Critical issue identification
4. Warning generation for moderate risks
5. Mitigation recommendation synthesis
6. Integration with issue patterns for historical context
7. Risk-informed blocking decisions
