Interactive UAT test execution guide for manual testing workflows.

**Mission**: Guide human testers through structured UAT test execution with clear pass/fail criteria.

**Repository Lessons** (3 SDs analyzed):
- **Structured Test Scenarios** (SD-UAT-002, SD-UAT-003, SD-UAT-020): Pre-defined test IDs (TEST-AUTH-001, etc.) enable consistent execution
- **Test Evidence** (SD-UAT-020): Screenshots and execution logs critical for approval evidence
- **Interactive Guidance** (All UAT SDs): Step-by-step prompts prevent test steps being skipped

**Core Philosophy**: "Manual testing is art and science. Structure ensures consistency."
