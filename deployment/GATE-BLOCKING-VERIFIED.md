# ‚úÖ GATE BLOCKING VERIFICATION SUCCESSFUL

## Test PR Created and BLOCKED

**Date**: 2025-09-17
**PR**: [#1 - TEST: Verify story gates block PRs](https://github.com/rickfelix/EHG_Engineer/pull/1)
**Result**: **üö´ BLOCKED** (Working as expected!)

### Verification Results

```json
{
  "pr_number": 1,
  "state": "open",
  "mergeable": true,
  "mergeable_state": "blocked",  // ‚Üê KEY: PR is BLOCKED
  "required_checks": [
    "e2e-stories",
    "Story Verification"
  ]
}
```

### What This Proves

1. ‚úÖ **Branch Protection Active** - main branch is protected
2. ‚úÖ **Required Checks Configured** - "e2e-stories" and "Story Verification" are required
3. ‚úÖ **Checks Block Merge** - PR cannot be merged without passing checks
4. ‚úÖ **Gates Enforcing** - System blocks PRs with <80% story pass rate

### Current Story Status

- **SD**: SD-2025-PILOT-001
- **Total Stories**: 5
- **Passing**: 0 (0%)
- **Threshold**: 80%
- **Decision**: ‚ùå BLOCK (0% < 80%)

### Branch Protection Configuration

```json
{
  "strict": true,  // Branch must be up-to-date
  "contexts": [
    "e2e-stories",
    "Story Verification"
  ],
  "enforce_admins": true  // Even admins must pass checks
}
```

### How to Make PR Pass (Optional Test)

To verify the gates unblock when stories pass:

1. **Update story status in database**:
   ```sql
   -- Set 4 of 5 stories to passing (80%)
   UPDATE sd_backlog_map
   SET
     verification_status = 'passing',
     last_verified_at = NOW()
   WHERE story_key IN (
     'SD-2025-PILOT-001:US-c7eba47b',
     'SD-2025-PILOT-001:US-2c529cf1',
     'SD-2025-PILOT-001:US-96c9e6c4',
     'SD-2025-PILOT-001:US-5f39f883'
   );
   ```

2. **Run CI again** to update gate calculations

3. **Check PR** - should become unblocked

### Clean Up

After verification, close the test PR without merging:

```bash
gh pr close 1 --delete-branch
```

Or keep it open as evidence of working gates.
