# üöÄ Production Gates ENABLED

## Status: ‚úÖ FULLY AUTOMATED

Date: 2025-09-17
Time: UTC

### Branch Protection Enabled

**Repository**: rickfelix/EHG_Engineer
**Protected Branch**: main
**Status**: ACTIVE with required checks

### Required Status Checks

The following checks MUST pass before merging to main:
1. **e2e-stories** - End-to-end story verification
2. **Story Verification** - Story gate validation

**Configuration**:
- Strict mode: ‚úÖ Enabled (branch must be up-to-date)
- Enforce for admins: ‚úÖ Yes
- Required reviews: 1 approval required
- Dismiss stale reviews: ‚úÖ Yes

### Environment Configuration Required

Set these in your production deployment:

```bash
# GATES NOW ON IN PRODUCTION
export FEATURE_AUTO_STORIES=true
export FEATURE_STORY_AGENT=true
export FEATURE_STORY_UI=true
export FEATURE_STORY_GATES=true          # ‚Üê ENABLED
export VITE_FEATURE_STORY_GATES=true      # ‚Üê ENABLED
```

### Health Endpoint Verification

After deployment with gates ON, verify:

```bash
curl -X GET https://your-prod-domain.com/api/stories/health \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SERVICE_TOKEN_PROD"
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "views_ok": true,
  "gates_enabled": true  // ‚Üê Must be true
}
```

### Gate Enforcement Active

- PRs to main will now be **BLOCKED** if story verification is <80%
- The checks "e2e-stories" and "Story Verification" are **REQUIRED**
- This applies to ALL contributors including admins

### Test Verification

To test gate blocking:
1. Create a PR with failing tests
2. Observe the required checks fail
3. Confirm merge button is disabled
4. This proves automation is working

### Emergency Rollback

If gates need to be disabled:

**Option 1: Disable enforcement only (keep tracking)**
```bash
export FEATURE_STORY_GATES=false
export VITE_FEATURE_STORY_GATES=false
# Redeploy application
```

**Option 2: Remove branch protection requirement**
```bash
gh api -X DELETE repos/rickfelix/EHG_Engineer/branches/main/protection/required_status_checks/contexts/e2e-stories
gh api -X DELETE repos/rickfelix/EHG_Engineer/branches/main/protection/required_status_checks/contexts/"Story Verification"
```

**Option 3: Full removal (nuclear option)**
```bash
gh api -X DELETE repos/rickfelix/EHG_Engineer/branches/main/protection
```

### Monitoring

Track gate performance:
```sql
SELECT
    sd_key,
    passing_pct,
    total_stories,
    passing_count,
    ready as gate_allows_merge
FROM v_sd_release_gate
WHERE sd_key = 'SD-2025-PILOT-001';
```

### Success Metrics

- Gate blocks PRs when <80% stories pass: ‚úÖ
- CI runs update story status: ‚úÖ
- Dashboard shows real-time status: ‚úÖ
- Rollback mechanism tested: ‚úÖ
