      "title": "Executive Summary",
      "content": "Successfully implemented two quality gate hardenings with grace periods. Coverage floor raised from 35% to 50% with 'coverage-grace' label allowing 2 PRs temporary bypass. Bundle cap reduced from 512KB to 480KB absolute limit. Both changes include appropriate warnings and maintain existing delta checks. Total: 20 lines changed across 4 files."

      "title": "Known Issues & Risks",
      "content": "**Known Issues:**\n1. No automated grace period tracking (manual count)\n2. Coverage currently at 75% (well above 50% floor)\n3. Bundle size status unknown (need to measure)\n\n**Risks:**\n1. Grace period could be abused without tracking\n2. 480KB might block legitimate features\n3. Teams may rely on grace instead of fixing coverage\n\n**Mitigations:**\n1. Add GitHub API tracking for grace uses\n2. Monitor bundle sizes over next 3 PRs\n3. Weekly review of grace label usage"

      "title": "Action Items for Receiver",
      "content": "**Immediate Actions:**\n1. Regenerate CLAUDE.md with new quality gates\n2. Create test PR to verify grace period works\n3. Measure current bundle size vs 480KB limit\n\n**Short-term (1 week):**\n4. Implement grace period tracking via GitHub API\n5. Create dashboard for quality metrics\n6. Document grace period process in team wiki\n\n**Medium-term (1 month):**\n7. Review grace period usage patterns\n8. Consider raising coverage to 60% if stable\n9. Evaluate bundle size trends\n\n**Long-term:**\n10. Automate ratcheting based on green PR streaks\n11. Implement per-component coverage targets"
