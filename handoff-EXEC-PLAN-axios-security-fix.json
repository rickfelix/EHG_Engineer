      "content": "Successfully resolved axios high-severity vulnerability (DoS through lack of data size check) by pinning version to 1.12.2 and adding npm overrides. The vulnerability affected versions <1.12.0; our installed 1.12.2 was already safe but npm audit had a false positive. Total change: 4 lines in package.json (version pin + overrides section)."

Address ws vulnerability (production impact)\n5. Review puppeteer/lighthouse upgrade path\n6. Document security update process\n\n**Medium-term (1 month):**\n7. Implement automated vulnerability scanning\n8. Create security update policy\n9. Consider Dependabot or similar tool\n\n**Long-term:**\n10. Regular dependency audits (monthly)\n11. Establish CVE response SLA"
