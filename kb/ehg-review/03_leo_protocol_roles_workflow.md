## LEO Protocol v4.1.2 - Database-First

### Current Version
**Version**: 4.1.2_database_first
**Status**: ACTIVE
**Storage**: Database table `leo_protocols`
**Enforcement**: Mandatory for all operations

### Core Principles

#### Database-First Architecture
- **NO filesystem storage** for protocols, SDs, or PRDs
- All protocol data stored in `leo_protocols` table
- Sub-agents defined in `leo_sub_agents` table
- Handoffs tracked in `leo_handoff_templates` table
- Real-time updates via Supabase subscriptions

#### Quality Gates
- **Minimum threshold**: 85% for stage progression
- **Automated scoring**: EVA validates against rubric
- **Remediation**: Automatic task generation for failures
- **Exception process**: Human intervention for blocked gates

#### Control Points
- **Mandatory handoffs**: 7-9 validation checkpoints
- **Context management**: Token usage monitoring
- **Boundary enforcement**: Strict scope control
- **Audit trail**: Complete history of all operations

### State Management

#### Workflow States
