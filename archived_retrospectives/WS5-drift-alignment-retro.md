```

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Custom Operator Pattern**
   - Native Kubernetes integration
   - CRD-based configuration
   - Controller reconciliation loop

2. **Webhook Validation**
   - Preventive drift control
   - Real-time enforcement
   - Fail-safe design

3. **Multi-Strategy Remediation**
   - Flexible response options
   - Severity-based automation
   - Manual override capability

## Metrics & Performance

### Operational Targets
| Metric | Target | Design Capability |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| Detection Time | <2 min | 2 min |
| Remediation Time | <15 min | 5-15 min |
| Compliance Score | >90% | Algorithm ready |
| Success Rate | >95% | Auto-remediation |
| False Positives | <5% | Configurable |

### Resource Requirements
- **Operator**: 256Mi RAM, 100m CPU
- **Scanner**: Runs every 15 minutes
- **Reporter**: Runs every 6 hours
- **Storage**: ConfigMaps + S3

## Integration Summary

### With Previous Workstreams

| Workstream | Integration Point | Status |
|------------|------------------|--------|
| WS1 (Signing) | SLSA verification webhook | ✅ |
| WS2 (Policies) | Policy drift monitoring | ✅ |
| WS3 (GitOps) | ArgoCD sync validation | ✅ |
| WS4 (Credentials) | Lane separation checks | ✅ |
| WS6 (Observability) | Metrics and dashboards | ✅ |

### Complete System Architecture
1. **WS1**: Provides signed artifacts
2. **WS2**: Defines admission policies
3. **WS3**: Manages GitOps deployment
4. **WS4**: Enforces credential separation
5. **WS5**: Detects and corrects drift
6. **WS6**: Monitors everything

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Operator failure | LOW | HIGH | HA deployment, health checks |
| Webhook blocking | LOW | CRITICAL | Fail-open policy |
| Remediation loops | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | Retry limits, backoff |
| Alert fatigue | MEDIUM | LOW | Severity filtering |

## Gaps & Limitations

### Technical Gaps
1. **Machine Learning**: No predictive drift detection
2. **Multi-cluster**: Single cluster only
3. **Cost Analysis**: No cost impact assessment

### Operational Gaps
1. **Runbooks**: Need incident response procedures
2. **Training**: Team needs operator knowledge
3. **Tuning**: Thresholds need production data

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
1. **CRD Design**: Clean, extensible API
2. **Webhook Integration**: Effective prevention layer
3. **Analytics Pipeline**: Comprehensive metrics
4. **Documentation**: Complete SOP coverage

### What Could Improve
1. **Testing**: Need chaos engineering tests
2. **Visualization**: More dashboard variety
3. **Automation**: ML-based threshold tuning
4. **Integration**: Tighter ArgoCD coupling

## Complete System Validation

### All Workstreams Complete (6/6)
- ✅ **Week 1**: WS1, WS2, WS4, WS6
- ✅ **Week 2**: WS3, WS5

### System Capabilities
1. **Supply Chain Security**: SLSA L3 with Sigstore
2. **Policy Enforcement**: Kyverno admission control
3. **Credential Isolation**: Lane separation enforced
4. **GitOps Automation**: ArgoCD continuous deployment
5. **Drift Prevention**: 2-minute detection, auto-remediation
