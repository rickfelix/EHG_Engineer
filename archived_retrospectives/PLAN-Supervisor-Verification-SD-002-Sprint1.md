## 📋 Issues & Recommendations

### Critical Issues: NONE ✅

### Minor Issues (Non-blocking)
1. **ML Model Training**: Currently uses simplified data processing
   - **Impact**: Medium - affects prediction accuracy
   - **Recommendation**: Implement proper tokenization in Sprint 2
   - **Timeline**: Can be addressed during Story 4 (Smart Search)

2. **Cache Cleanup**: Manual flush mechanism
   - **Impact**: Low - memory usage still within targets
   - **Recommendation**: Implement automated cleanup in Sprint 3
   - **Timeline**: When implementing Story 11 (History & Bookmarks)

### Recommendations for Sprint 2
1. ✅ **Start with Story 2 (Quick Actions)** - builds naturally on existing shortcuts
2. ✅ **Parallel development of Story 8 (Accessibility)** - can run alongside other work
3. ⚠️ **Delay Story 3 (Command Palette)** - until UX mockups are ready
4. ✅ **Implement proper ML tokenization** - as part of Story 4 preparation
