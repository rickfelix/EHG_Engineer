## Source Documents
1. **EHG Strategic Playbook (Feb 2026)** — 7 strategic imperatives for the next 24 months
2. **Google Advisory** — Compute arbitrage, orchestration engine, vertical integration, proprietary context
3. **OpenAI Advisory** — Model-agnostic positioning, capability lattice, governance moat, trust as strategic asset

---

## Problem Statement

EHG has received convergent but differently-emphasized strategic advice from three independent sources. All three agree that intelligence is commoditizing and EHG's moat lives above the model layer — but they differ on emphasis, timing, and execution priorities. The problem: consolidate these into a single executable doctrine that maps to SDs through LEO, resolving tensions where the sources disagree.

## Discovery Summary

### Convergence (All 3 Sources Agree)
1. **Intelligence is commoditizing** — moat lives above the model layer in governance, orchestration, and data
2. **Orchestration/governance is EHG's core differentiator** (LEO Protocol + EVA)
3. **Model-agnostic compute arbitrage is essential** — no single vendor dependency
4. **Data flywheel / proprietary context is the compounding engine** — every uncaptured interaction is permanent data loss
5. **Capability reuse across ventures** is the lattice that survives individual venture death

### Key Tensions Between Sources

| Tension | Google | Playbook | OpenAI |
|---------|--------|----------|--------|
| Compute strategy | 95% local, aggressive | Balanced, hardware refresh plan | Model-agnostic, doesn't emphasize local |
| LEO positioning | Internal engine | Potential product (Strategy 7) | "Kubernetes for AI ventures" |
| Venture targeting | Exelon-adjacent verticals | "Hard-to-solve, hard-to-adopt" quadrant | Abstract — build capability lattice |
| Execution timeline | Unstructured | 24-month priority matrix | Unstructured |
| LEO productization | Internal only | P2 priority | Accelerate (data window closing) |

### 13 Strategic Concepts Identified

| # | Concept | Sources | Priority |
|---|---------|---------|----------|
| 1 | Data Flywheel / EVA Interaction Capture | All 3 | P0 |
| 2 | Model Arbitrage / Compute Routing | All 3 | P0 |
| 3 | Capability Lattice / Registry | OpenAI, Google | P0 |
| 4 | Difficulty Matrix / Venture Filter | Playbook | P0 |
| 5 | Outcome-Based Pricing / Attribution | Playbook | P0 |
| 6 | Trust / Anti-Advertising Positioning | Playbook, OpenAI | P1 |
| 7 | Platform Tax / MCP Standards | Playbook | P1 |
| 8 | Proprietary Context Pipelines | Google, Playbook | P1 |
| 9 | Hardware Strategy / M5 Refresh | Playbook | P1 |
| 10 | Portfolio Intelligence Dashboard | OpenAI | P1 |
| 11 | LEO as Product / Governance Framework | All 3 | P2 |
| 12 | Vertical Integration / Lifecycle Mapping | Google | Already exists (LEO) |
| 13 | Technology Trajectory / Macro Forces | All 3 | Already has SD |

## Analysis

### Arguments For (Pursuing Consolidated Strategy)
- All three independent advisory sources converge on the same core thesis — rare signal strength
- EHG already has the infrastructure stack (LEO, EVA, Supabase, hardware) — execution cost is primarily time, not capital
- Zero-cost strategies (#5 outcome pricing, #6 trust positioning, #4 difficulty filter) can ship immediately
- The data flywheel (#1) compounds over time — every day of delay is permanent, irrecoverable data loss
- Trust vacuum from frontier labs' ad pivot is a time-limited window of opportunity
- Anti-advertising trust positioning fills a genuine market gap created by OpenAI/Google ad pivots

### Arguments Against (Honest Risks)
- 7 strategies + 6 brainstorms + 5 ventures + LEO overhead = attention fragmentation beyond coherence for a solo founder
- Venture PMF is assumed but unproven — the strategy optimizes the factory without validating the products
- LEO productization requires ecosystem scale and external demand that doesn't exist yet
- Outcome-based pricing attribution is operationally brutal (multi-year problem at enterprise vendors with full legal teams)
- The data flywheel requires interaction volume that may not exist at solo-founder scale
- The governance layer is only valuable if the underlying ventures are valuable

---

## Team Perspectives

### Challenger
- **Blind Spots**:
  1. Governance layer is only valuable if ventures have genuine PMF — the strategy never stress-tests this assumption
  2. "Hard-to-solve, hard-to-adopt" is a filter, not a strategy — difficulty is a moat only if EHG has structural advantages in those hard domains
  3. Data flywheel assumes volume and quality that don't yet exist at solo-founder scale
- **Assumptions at Risk**:
  1. Intelligence commoditizes fast enough before larger players build their own orchestration layer
  2. Outcome-based pricing is achievable across all ventures (attribution problems are brutal)
  3. Platform tax asymmetry via open standards is viable for a solo-founder operation
- **Worst Case**: Two years of sophisticated orchestration around ventures that generate no meaningful revenue, with a beautiful governance system and no business
- **Solo Founder Risk**: LEO Protocol becomes a second job. Attention fragments beyond coherence. No recovery path for key-person failure.

### Visionary
- **Opportunities**:
  1. Governance-as-infrastructure play — LEO is a coordination primitive. EHG will have the largest private dataset of AI-assisted strategic decisions with measurable outcomes.
  2. Venture outcomes as financial instruments — outcome-based contracts create royalty-like streams that can be structured and packaged
  3. Trust Stack — "EHG Trust Mark" certification across the venture portfolio creates a trust network effect
- **Synergies**: All 6 of today's brainstorms interconnect: Research Dept = flywheel intake → richer EVA context → better LEAD decisions → better ventures → more outcome data → better research calibration. Narrative Risk = trust portfolio insurance. App Ranking = opportunity radar. Model Library = multi-model stress testing. Exponential Prediction = timing window. Dual Strategy = two go-to-market machines.
- **Upside Scenario**: 24 months — $6-12M ARR across 5 ventures, LEO Protocol published as open standard with 30-founder ecosystem, $1.5-3M governance licensing ARR, $15-25M portfolio enterprise value with team of 3 humans + AI operating layer
- **Category Creation**: "AI-Native Holding Company" — governance-native venture portfolio where orchestration IS the competitive advantage

### Pragmatist
- **Feasibility**: 2/10 for all 7 strategies simultaneously. 7/10 for focused 90-day plan.
- **Resource Requirements**: 220-360 effective hours over 90 days after LEO overhead. ~$0 for zero-cost strategies, ~$8-12K for M5 Ultra (Q4 2026)
- **Constraints**:
  1. Attention is the bottleneck, not capital or compute — WIP limit of 2-3 items max
  2. LEO Protocol is both competitive moat AND overhead tax — must stabilize before adding initiatives
  3. Strategies #3 and #7 require network effects that don't yet exist
- **90-Day Plan**: Days 1-7: zero-cost decisions (outcome pricing, difficulty matrix, anti-ad positioning). Days 8-30: EVA interaction capture schema + pipeline. Days 31-60: LEO gate stability + EVA data quality review. Days 61-90: first MCP integration + M5 decision.
- **What to Skip**: LEO productization (#7) for all of 2026. Today's 6 brainstorms as active work items. MCP/platform tax below day 60.

### Synthesis
- **Consensus Points**: Attention is the real bottleneck (not compute/capital). Data flywheel is highest-leverage infrastructure. Zero-cost strategies should ship immediately. Venture PMF is the unstated prerequisite. Trust positioning fills a real vacuum.
- **Tension Points**: LEO productization timing (Visionary: accelerate vs. Pragmatist: skip 2026). Today's brainstorm backlog (Visionary: interconnected infrastructure vs. Pragmatist: skip all). Outcome pricing viability (Challenger: wishlist vs. others: commit).
- **Composite Risk**: Medium-High — strategy is sound but solo-founder execution model creates fragmentation risk

### Orphaned Concepts (No SD, Deferred)

| Concept | Reason to Defer |
|---|---|
| Outcome-Based Pricing | Business model decision, not code. Implement as policy. |

| LEO as Product | Needs external demand. Pragmatist: 2027 earliest. |
| Portfolio Intelligence Dashboard | Could enhance Visual Playground SD later. |

## The Moat Architecture

EHG's compound moat is not a single thing — it is five layers that reinforce each other:

```
TRUST MOAT (Narrative Risk SD)
  Anti-ad positioning, portfolio trust credential, data sovereignty
    |
GOVERNANCE MOAT (LEO Protocol — already exists)
  LEAD→PLAN→EXEC, gates, audit trails, quality thresholds
    |
ORCHESTRATION MOAT (EVA + Org Structure)
  Multi-agent coordination, department messaging, agent routing
    |
DATA MOAT (Data Flywheel SD — NEW)
  EVA interaction capture, preference data, cross-venture intelligence
    |
CAPABILITY MOAT (Capability Lattice SD — NEW)
  Reusable capabilities, graph centrality, venture-independent assets
```

Each layer compounds the others. The trust moat attracts users. The governance moat ensures quality. The orchestration moat enables speed. The data moat enables learning. The capability moat enables reuse. Together they create a position that:
- Open-source model releases cannot replicate (they lack the data + capability layers)
- Frontier labs cannot replicate (they lack the governance + trust layers)
- Competitors cannot replicate (they lack the compound effect of all five)

---

## Open Questions
- At what interaction volume does the data flywheel become training-signal-worthy? (Challenger concern)
- Which existing ventures pass the difficulty matrix filter? (Need to apply retroactively)
- Should outcome-based pricing be piloted with a single venture before committing across all 5?
- When does LEO productization become viable — what trigger event signals external demand?

## Suggested Next Steps
1. Begin LEAD phase for SD-LEO-FEAT-DATA-FLYWHEEL-001 (highest priority gap)
2. Continue existing SD execution pipeline (Tech Trajectory, Narrative Risk, Research Dept now enriched)
3. Apply difficulty matrix retroactively to the 5 active ventures — kill or deprioritize anything that fails
4. Adopt outcome-based pricing as a policy decision (no code, just a commitment)
5. Draft anti-advertising positioning statement for EHG brand
