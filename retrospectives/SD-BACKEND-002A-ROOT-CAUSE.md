# SD-BACKEND-002A Root Cause Analysis

**Date**: 2025-10-03
**SD**: SD-BACKEND-002A - Core Mock Data Replacement
**Phase**: Implementation (Phase 2 - API Development)
**Severity**: CRITICAL - Architecture Mismatch
**Discovered By**: EXEC Agent during Phase 3 (Testing)

---

## üî¥ Issue Summary

**17 API endpoints were implemented using Next.js patterns in a Vite/React SPA application**, resulting in non-functional backend APIs that cannot execute.

---

## üîç Root Cause

### Primary Cause: Missing Application Architecture Verification

**EXEC agent failed to verify the target application's architecture before implementing APIs.**

### What Went Wrong

1. **No Pre-Implementation Check** (CRITICAL MISS)
   - EXEC did not run `pwd` to confirm directory location
   - EXEC did not check `package.json` for framework (Next.js vs Vite)
   - EXEC did not verify `vite.config.ts` existence
   - EXEC did not confirm API routing mechanism

2. **Pattern Matching Without Context**
   - Saw `app/api/` directory structure
   - Assumed Next.js because of directory pattern
   - Implemented Next.js `route.ts` files with `NextRequest`/`NextResponse`
   - **Never verified** if Next.js was actually installed

3. **Missing MANDATORY Pre-Implementation Checklist**
   - Per CLAUDE.md Section: "üö® EXEC Agent Implementation Requirements"
   - **Step 0: APPLICATION CHECK** was NOT executed:
     ```bash
     # REQUIRED but SKIPPED:
     cd /mnt/c/_EHG/ehg && pwd
     git remote -v  # Should show rickfelix/ehg.git
     cat package.json | grep "next"  # Would have shown NO Next.js!
     ```

4. **No Sub-Agent Consultation**
   - Principal Systems Analyst sub-agent NOT triggered
   - Would have detected "existing implementation" of Supabase client
   - Would have flagged architecture mismatch

---

## üìä Impact Analysis

### Wasted Effort
- ‚úÖ Phase 1 (Database): 8-12h - **CORRECT** (Supabase migrations)
- ‚ùå Phase 2 (APIs): 32-40h - **WASTED** (Next.js routes don't work in Vite)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Phase 3 (Tests): 10-12h - **PARTIAL WASTE** (tests need rewrite)
- **Total Wasted**: ~42-52 hours of implementation time

### Recovery Cost
- Delete 17 Next.js API route files
- Create Supabase-first React hooks: 8-12h
- Rewrite tests for direct Supabase calls: 4-6h
- **Total Recovery**: 12-18 hours

### Net Loss
- **~30-34 hours of unnecessary work** (42-52h wasted - 12-18h to correct)

## üéØ Specific LEO Protocol Violations

### 1. EXEC Pre-Implementation Checklist (CLAUDE.md Lines 188-217)

**VIOLATED**: All 7 steps of mandatory checklist were skipped

```markdown
## EXEC Pre-Implementation Checklist
- [ ] URL verified: [SKIPPED - no URL check]
- [ ] Page accessible: [SKIPPED]
- [ ] Component identified: [SKIPPED]
- [ ] Application path: [SKIPPED - never confirmed /mnt/c/_EHG/ehg]
- [ ] Port confirmed: [SKIPPED]
- [ ] Screenshot taken: [SKIPPED]
- [ ] Target location confirmed: [SKIPPED]
```

### 2. Sub-Agent Activation (CLAUDE.md Lines 505-507)

**SHOULD HAVE TRIGGERED**: Principal Systems Analyst
- Trigger phrase: "existing implementation" ‚úì (Supabase client existed)
- Trigger phrase: "codebase check" (should have been done)
- **RESULT**: Sub-agent not activated, duplicate/conflicting architecture created

### 3. Application Context Rule (CLAUDE.md Lines 30-48)

**VIOLATED**: "‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: During EXEC Phase Implementation"
- Step 1: "Read PRD from EHG_Engineer database" ‚úì DONE
- Step 2: "Navigate to `/mnt/c/_EHG/ehg/` for implementation" ‚ö†Ô∏è ASSUMED, NOT VERIFIED
- Step 3: "Make code changes in EHG application (NOT in EHG_Engineer!)" ‚úì DONE
- Step 4: "Push changes to EHG's GitHub repo" ‚è≥ PENDING
- **FAILURE POINT**: Step 2 - never explicitly verified architecture

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Prevention Measures

### Immediate Protocol Updates Required

#### 1. **MANDATORY Architecture Check Script**

Create `scripts/verify-app-architecture.js`:
```javascript
// Check framework (Next.js vs Vite vs other)
// Check API mechanism (App Router vs Pages vs Edge Functions vs Supabase)
// Output: "NEXT_APP_ROUTER" | "VITE_SPA" | "REMIX" | etc.
```

**Enforcement**: EXEC must run this BEFORE Phase 2 (API Development)

#### 2. **Enhanced Pre-Implementation Checklist**

Add to CLAUDE.md Section "üö® EXEC Agent Implementation Requirements":

```markdown
### STEP 0: ARCHITECTURE VERIFICATION (NEW - MANDATORY)

Before ANY backend implementation:

1. **Confirm Framework**
   ```bash
   cd /mnt/c/_EHG/ehg
   cat package.json | grep -E '"(next|vite|remix|gatsby)"'
   ```

2. **Check API Mechanism**
   - Next.js: Look for `app/api/` or `pages/api/`
   - Vite: Look for Supabase client or backend server
   - Document finding BEFORE proceeding

3. **Verify Existing Patterns**
   ```bash
   find . -name "*.config.*" | xargs cat  # Check build config
   grep -r "createClient" src/  # Check Supabase usage
   ```

**REQUIREMENT**: Create architecture confirmation document before Phase 2
**BLOCKER**: Cannot proceed to API implementation without this verification
```

#### 3. **Sub-Agent Trigger Enhancement**

Update Principal Systems Analyst triggers:
- Add: "backend implementation" (keyword)
- Add: "API development" (keyword)
- Add: "PHASE_2_START" (event trigger)

**Action**: Run systems analyst BEFORE implementing any backend logic

#### 4. **PRD Specification Requirement**

**PLAN Agent Responsibility**: PRDs MUST include:
```markdown
## Target Application Architecture

- **Framework**: Next.js 14 (App Router) | Vite 5 | etc.
- **Backend Pattern**: API Routes | Supabase Direct | Edge Functions | Express
- **Verification Command**: `cat package.json | grep vite`
- **Expected Output**: `"vite": "^5.4.20"`
```

If PRD lacks this section ‚Üí EXEC must request clarification

## üìù Lessons Learned

### For EXEC Agents
1. **NEVER ASSUME ARCHITECTURE** - Always verify framework/build tool first
2. **Run the checklist** - It exists for exactly this reason
3. **When in doubt, check package.json** - 30 seconds prevents 30+ hours of waste
4. **Trigger sub-agents early** - Systems Analyst would have caught this

### For PLAN Agents
1. **Include architecture specs in PRDs** - Make framework explicit
2. **Verify implementation plan matches app structure** - Check before handoff
3. **Sub-agent review for backend work** - Database Architect + Systems Analyst

### For LEAD Agents
1. **Spot-check implementations early** - Quick review after Phase 1 complete
2. **Question unfamiliar patterns** - Next.js APIs in unknown app = red flag
3. **Enforce protocol compliance** - Checklists exist for a reason

## ‚úÖ Corrective Action Plan

### Immediate (This SD)
1. ‚úÖ Document root cause (this file)
2. ‚è≥ Delete incorrect Next.js API files
3. ‚è≥ Implement Supabase-first architecture (Option A)
4. ‚è≥ Update tests for new architecture
5. ‚è≥ Complete frontend integration

### Short-Term (Next 3 SDs)
1. Create `scripts/verify-app-architecture.js` utility
2. Update CLAUDE.md with enhanced Step 0 checklist
3. Add architecture verification to all PRD templates
4. Update sub-agent triggers for backend work

### Long-Term (Protocol v4.3.0)
1. Add automated architecture checks to CI/CD
2. Create architecture decision records (ADRs) requirement
3. Pre-flight validation script that EXEC must run
4. Add "Architecture Verified: YES/NO" to all handoffs

---

## üéì Knowledge Capture

### Pattern Recognition
**Red Flags That Should Trigger Verification**:
- ‚úã Seeing `app/api/` directory (could be Next.js OR just organization)
- ‚úã Implementing "backend" in a "frontend" repo
- ‚úã Using framework-specific imports (`next/server`, etc.)
- ‚úã No explicit confirmation of framework in conversation

**Green Lights (Safe to Proceed)**:
- ‚úÖ `package.json` checked and framework confirmed
- ‚úÖ PRD explicitly states architecture
- ‚úÖ Sub-agent (Systems Analyst) reviewed existing patterns
- ‚úÖ Pre-implementation checklist completed

### Success Criteria for "Done"
Before marking any backend implementation as complete:
1. Architecture verified and documented
2. Implementation matches verified architecture
3. Tests pass against actual implementation
4. Frontend integration successful
5. No framework mismatches exist
