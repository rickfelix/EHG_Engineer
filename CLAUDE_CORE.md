# CLAUDE_CORE.md - LEO Protocol Core Context

**Generated**: 2025-10-25 2:16:13 PM
**Protocol**: LEO vv4.2.0_story_gates
**Purpose**: Essential workflow context for all sessions (15k chars)

---

## Session Prologue (Short)

1. **Follow LEAD→PLAN→EXEC** - Target ≥85% gate pass rate
2. **Use sub-agents** - Architect, QA, Reviewer - summarize outputs
3. **Database-first** - No markdown files as source of truth
4. **USE PROCESS SCRIPTS** - ⚠️ NEVER bypass add-prd-to-database.js, unified-handoff-system.js ⚠️
5. **Small PRs** - Target ≤100 lines, max 400 with justification
6. **Priority-first** - Use `npm run prio:top3` to justify work

*For copy-paste version: see `templates/session-prologue.md` (generate via `npm run session:prologue`)*

## 🏗️ Application Architecture - CRITICAL CONTEXT

### Two Distinct Applications:
1. **EHG_Engineer** (Management Dashboard) - WHERE YOU ARE NOW
   - **Path**: `/mnt/c/_EHG/EHG_Engineer/`
   - **Purpose**: LEO Protocol dashboard for managing Strategic Directives & PRDs
   - **Database**: dedlbzhpgkmetvhbkyzq (Supabase)
   - **GitHub**: https://github.com/rickfelix/EHG_Engineer.git
   - **Port**: 3000-3001
   - **Role**: MANAGEMENT TOOL ONLY - no customer features here!

2. **EHG** (Business Application) - IMPLEMENTATION TARGET
   - **Path**: `/mnt/c/_EHG/ehg/`
   - **Purpose**: The actual customer-facing business application
   - **Database**: liapbndqlqxdcgpwntbv (Supabase)
   - **GitHub**: https://github.com/rickfelix/ehg.git
   - **Built with**: Vite + React + Shadcn + TypeScript
   - **Role**: WHERE ALL FEATURES GET IMPLEMENTED

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: During EXEC Phase Implementation
1. **Read PRD** from EHG_Engineer database
2. **Navigate** to `/mnt/c/_EHG/ehg/` for implementation
3. **Make code changes** in EHG application (NOT in EHG_Engineer!)
4. **Push changes** to EHG's GitHub repo: `rickfelix/ehg.git`
5. **Track progress** in EHG_Engineer dashboard

### 🔄 Workflow Relationship
```
EHG_Engineer (Management)          EHG App (Implementation)
├── Strategic Directives     →     Features implemented here
├── PRDs                     →     Code changes made here
├── Progress Tracking        ←     Results verified from here
└── Dashboard Views          ←     No changes here!
```

## Execution Philosophy

## 🧠 EXECUTION PHILOSOPHY (Read First!)

These principles override default behavior and must be internalized before starting work:

### Quality-First (PARAMOUNT)
**Get it right, not fast.** Correctness and completeness are MORE IMPORTANT than speed.
- Take the time needed to understand requirements fully
- Verify BEFORE implementing, test BEFORE claiming completion
- 2-4 hours of careful implementation beats 6-12 hours of rework
- If rushing leads to mistakes, you haven't saved time - you've wasted it
- "Done right" > "Done fast" - ALWAYS

### Testing-First (MANDATORY)
**Build confidence through comprehensive testing.**
- E2E testing is MANDATORY, not optional
- 30-60 minute investment saves 4-6 hours of rework
- 100% user story coverage required
- Both unit tests AND E2E tests must pass
- Tests are not overhead - they ARE the work

### Database-First (REQUIRED)
**Zero markdown files.** Database tables are single source of truth.
- SDs → `strategic_directives_v2`
- PRDs → `product_requirements_v2`
- Handoffs → `sd_phase_handoffs`
- Retrospectives → `retrospectives`
- Sub-agent results → `sub_agent_execution_results`

### Validation-First (GATEKEEPING)
**Thorough validation BEFORE approval, full commitment AFTER.**
- LEAD validates: Real problem? Feasible solution? Resources available?
- After LEAD approval: SCOPE LOCK - deliver what was approved
- Exception: Critical blocker + human approval + new SD for deferred work

### Context-Aware (PROACTIVE)
**Monitor token usage proactively throughout execution.**
- Report context health in EVERY handoff
- HEALTHY (<70%), WARNING (70-90%), CRITICAL (90-95%), EMERGENCY (>95%)
- Use `/context-compact` when approaching WARNING threshold

### Application-Aware (VERIFICATION)
**Verify directory BEFORE writing ANY code.**
- `cd /mnt/c/_EHG/ehg && pwd` for customer features
- `git remote -v` to confirm correct repository
- Wrong directory = STOP immediately

### Evidence-Based (PROOF REQUIRED)
**Screenshot, test, verify. Claims without evidence are rejected.**
- Screenshot BEFORE and AFTER changes
- Test results with pass/fail counts
- CI/CD pipeline status (green checks required)
- Sub-agent verification results in database

**REMEMBER**: The goal is NOT to complete SDs quickly. The goal is to complete SDs CORRECTLY. A properly implemented SD that takes 8 hours is infinitely better than a rushed implementation that takes 4 hours but requires 6 hours of fixes.


## 🔄 Git Commit Guidelines

**Git Commit Guidelines**: `<type>(<SD-ID>): <subject>` format MANDATORY

**Required**: Type (feat/fix/docs/etc), SD-ID scope, imperative subject, AI attribution in footer
**Timing**: After checklist items, before context switches, at logical breakpoints
**Branch Strategy**: `eng/` prefix for EHG_Engineer, standard prefixes for EHG app features
**Size**: <100 lines ideal, <200 max

**Full Guidelines**: See `docs/03_protocols_and_standards/leo_git_commit_guidelines_v4.2.0.md`

## Database Operations - One Table at a Time

### REQUIRED: Database Operations Only

**⚠️ CRITICAL: One Table at a Time**
- When manipulating Supabase tables, **ALWAYS operate on ONE table at a time**
- Batch operations across multiple tables often fail or cause inconsistencies
- Complete each table operation fully before moving to the next table
- Verify success after each table operation before proceeding

**Strategic Directives**:
- ✅ Create in `strategic_directives_v2` table
- ✅ Use `scripts/create-strategic-directive.js` or dashboard
- ✅ ALL SD data must be in database, not files
- ✅ **One SD insertion at a time** - verify before next

**PRDs (Product Requirements)**:
- ✅ Create in `product_requirements_v2` table
- ✅ Use `scripts/add-prd-to-database.js`
- ✅ Link to SD via `strategic_directive_id` foreign key
- ✅ **One PRD insertion at a time** - verify before next

**Retrospectives**:
- ✅ Create in `retrospectives` table
- ✅ Use `scripts/generate-comprehensive-retrospective.js`
- ✅ Trigger: Continuous Improvement Coach sub-agent
- ✅ Link to SD via `sd_id` foreign key
- ✅ **One retrospective at a time** - verify before next

**Handoffs**:
- ✅ Store in handoff tracking tables
- ✅ 7-element structure required
- ✅ Link to SD and phase
- ✅ **One handoff at a time** - verify before next

**Progress & Verification**:
- ✅ Update database fields directly
- ✅ Store verification results in database
- ✅ Track in real-time via dashboard
- ✅ **One record update at a time** - verify before next

## 📊 Communication & Context

### Communication Style

**Brief by Default**: Responses should be concise and action-oriented unless the user explicitly requests detailed explanations.

**When to be Brief** (default):
- Status updates and progress reports
- Acknowledging commands or requests
- Confirming successful operations
- Error messages (summary + fix)
- Tool invocation descriptions

**When to be Verbose** (only if requested):
- User asks "explain in detail"
- User requests "comprehensive" or "thorough" analysis
- Teaching or knowledge transfer scenarios
- Complex debugging requiring full context
- Documentation generation

**Examples**:

| Context | ❌ Verbose (unnecessary) | ✅ Brief (preferred) |
|---------|------------------------|---------------------|
| File created | "I have successfully created the file at the specified path with all the requested content..." | "File created: path/to/file.md" |
| Test passed | "The test suite has been executed and all tests have passed successfully with 100% coverage..." | "✅ Tests passed (100% coverage)" |
| Next step | "Now I will proceed to the next step which involves updating the database schema..." | "Updating database schema..." |

### Context Economy Rules

**Core Principles**:
- **Response Budget**: ≤500 tokens default (unless complexity requires more)
- **Summarize > Paste**: Reference paths/links instead of full content
- **Fetch-on-Demand**: Name files first, retrieve only needed parts
- **Running Summaries**: Keep condensed handoff/PR descriptions

### Best Practices

**Efficient Context Usage**:
- **Quote selectively**: Show only relevant lines with context
- **Use file:line references**: `src/component.js:42-58` instead of full file
- **Batch related reads**: Minimize round-trips when exploring
- **Archive verbosity**: Move details to handoffs/database, not conversation

### Examples

| ❌ Inefficient | ✅ Efficient |
|----------------|--------------|
| Paste entire 500-line file | Quote lines 42-58 with `...` markers |
| Read file multiple times | Batch read relevant sections once |
| Repeat full error in response | Summarize error + reference line |
| Include all test output | Show failed tests + counts only |

### 🔄 MANDATORY: Server Restart Protocol
After ANY code changes:
1. **Kill the dev server**: `kill [PID]` or Ctrl+C
2. **Restart the server**: `npm run dev` or appropriate command
3. **Wait for ready message**: Confirm server is fully started
4. **Hard refresh browser**: Ctrl+Shift+R / Cmd+Shift+R
5. **Verify changes are live**: Test the new functionality

**WHY**: Dev servers may cache components, especially new files. Hot reload is NOT always reliable.

## Parallel Execution

**When to Use**: Modern AI supports parallel tool execution for independent operations. Use conservatively.

**Safe for Parallel Execution**:
- ✅ Reading multiple independent files for analysis
- ✅ Running multiple independent database queries
- ✅ Executing multiple read-only Git commands (status, log, diff)
- ✅ Multiple WebFetch calls to different URLs
- ✅ Batch file searches (multiple Glob operations)

**NOT Safe for Parallel Execution**:
- ❌ Write operations (Edit, Write tools)
- ❌ Database mutations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- ❌ Any operations where order matters
- ❌ Operations that depend on each other's results
- ❌ Git operations that modify state (commit, push, merge)

**Critical Constraint**: Context sharing between parallel operations is limited. Each operation receives the same initial context but cannot see other parallel operations' results until they all complete.

**Example Use Case**:
```
"Read the following 3 files for analysis:"
- Read src/component.tsx
- Read src/types.ts
- Read tests/component.test.tsx
```

**Anti-Pattern**:
```
"Read file A, then based on what you find, read file B"
(Must be sequential - second read depends on first)
```

## Quick Reference

## 📋 QUICK REFERENCE

### Component Sizing

| Lines of Code | Action | Rationale |
|---------------|--------|-----------|
| <200 | Consider combining | Too granular |
| **300-600** | ✅ **OPTIMAL** | Sweet spot for testing & maintenance |
| >800 | **MUST split** | Too complex, hard to test |

### Git Commits (Conventional Commits)

**Format**: `<type>(<SD-ID>): <subject>`

```bash
git commit -m "feat(SD-XXX): Brief description

Detailed explanation of changes.

🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"
```

**Types**: feat, fix, docs, refactor, test, chore, perf

### Server Restart (After ANY Changes)

```bash
# Kill
pkill -f "node server.js"

# Build (if UI changes)
npm run build:client

# Restart
PORT=3000 node server.js

# Hard refresh browser
# Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) / Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
```

### Parallel Execution (Save Time)

**When Safe**:
- ✅ Multiple independent file reads
- ✅ Multiple database queries (read-only)
- ✅ Sub-agent execution (different domains)

**NOT Safe**:
- ❌ Write operations
- ❌ Database mutations
- ❌ Sequential dependencies

**Example**:
```bash
# LEAD Pre-Approval: 4 sub-agents in parallel
node scripts/systems-analyst-codebase-audit.js <SD-ID> &
node scripts/database-architect-schema-review.js <SD-ID> &
node scripts/security-architect-assessment.js <SD-ID> &
node scripts/design-subagent-evaluation.js <SD-ID> &
wait

# Reduces time from 2 minutes sequential to 30 seconds parallel
```

### Context Efficiency Patterns

```javascript
// ❌ Inefficient
const { data } = await supabase.from('table').select('*');
console.log(data); // Dumps full JSON

// ✅ Efficient
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('table')
  .select('id, title, status')
  .limit(5);
console.log(`Found ${data.length} items`);
```

### Database Operations (One at a Time)

**CRITICAL**: When manipulating Supabase tables, operate on ONE table at a time.

```javascript
// ❌ Bad: Batch across tables
await Promise.all([
  supabase.from('table1').insert(data1),
  supabase.from('table2').insert(data2)
]);

// ✅ Good: Sequential, one table at a time
await supabase.from('table1').insert(data1);
// Verify success
await supabase.from('table2').insert(data2);
// Verify success
```

### Sub-Agent Orchestration

**Automated** (preferred):
```bash
# Orchestrator runs all required sub-agents for phase
node scripts/orchestrate-phase-subagents.js <PHASE> <SD-ID>

# Phases: LEAD_PRE_APPROVAL, PLAN_PRD, EXEC_IMPL, PLAN_VERIFY, LEAD_FINAL
```

**Manual** (if needed):
```bash
# QA Director
node scripts/qa-engineering-director-enhanced.js <SD-ID> --full-e2e

# GitHub Actions
node scripts/github-actions-verifier.js <SD-ID>

# Database Architect
node scripts/database-architect-schema-review.js <SD-ID>
```

### Testing Commands

```bash
# Unit tests (business logic)
npm run test:unit

# E2E tests (user flows)
npm run test:e2e

# Both (MANDATORY before EXEC→PLAN handoff)
npm run test:unit && npm run test:e2e
```

### Handoff Creation

```bash
# Unified handoff system (with auto sub-agent orchestration)
node scripts/unified-handoff-system.js execute <TYPE> <SD-ID>

# Types:
# - LEAD-to-PLAN
# - PLAN-to-EXEC
# - EXEC-to-PLAN (auto-runs PLAN_VERIFY sub-agents)
# - PLAN-to-LEAD (auto-runs LEAD_FINAL sub-agents)
```

### Progress Verification

```bash
# Check progress breakdown
node -e "
const { createClient } = require('@supabase/supabase-js');
const supabase = createClient(process.env.SUPABASE_URL, process.env.SUPABASE_ANON_KEY);
(async () => {
  const { data } = await supabase.rpc('get_progress_breakdown', { sd_id_param: 'SD-XXX' });
  console.log(JSON.stringify(data, null, 2));
})();
"
```

## 🔧 CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW

**Development Workflow**: MANDATORY server restart after ANY changes

**Steps**: Kill server → Build client (`npm run build:client`) → Restart server → Hard refresh browser
**Why**: No hot-reloading configured, dist/ serves compiled files
**Commands**: `pkill -f "node server.js" && npm run build:client && PORT=3000 node server.js`

**Complete Guide**: See `docs/reference/development-workflow.md`

## Knowledge Retrieval Commands

## 🔍 Knowledge Retrieval (Proactive Learning)

**SD-LEO-LEARN-001: Added 2025-10-25**

```bash
# Before starting any phase (MANDATORY for EXEC/PLAN, RECOMMENDED for LEAD)
node scripts/phase-preflight.js --phase <LEAD|PLAN|EXEC> --sd-id <UUID>

# Search for specific issues
node scripts/search-prior-issues.js "<issue description>"

# Generate fresh knowledge summaries (weekly)
node scripts/generate-knowledge-summary.js --category <category>
node scripts/generate-knowledge-summary.js --category all

# View existing summaries
ls docs/summaries/lessons/*.md
cat docs/summaries/lessons/database-lessons.md
```

**Philosophy**: Consult lessons BEFORE encountering issues, not after.

## Agent Responsibilities

| Agent | Code | Responsibilities | % Split |
|-------|------|------------------|----------|
| Implementation Agent | EXEC | Implementation based on PRD. **CRITICAL: Implementations happen in /mnt/c/_EHG/e... | I:30 = 30% |
| Strategic Leadership Agent | LEAD | Strategic planning, business objectives, final approval. **SIMPLICITY FIRST (PRE... | P:20 A:15 = 35% |
| Technical Planning Agent | PLAN | Technical design, PRD creation with comprehensive test plans, pre-automation val... | P:20 V:15 = 35% |

**Legend**: P=Planning, I=Implementation, V=Verification, A=Approval
**Total**: EXEC (30%) + LEAD (35%) + PLAN (35%) = 100%
