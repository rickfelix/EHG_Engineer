# Feature Reconnection Initiative - Strategic Directives Summary

**Created**: 2025-10-02
**Total SDs**: 10
**Status**: All SDs created in database (draft status)
**Database**: EHG_Engineer (dedlbzhpgkmetvhbkyzq)

## Executive Summary

Comprehensive audit revealed that the EHG application has approximately **$500K-$1M in development investment** completely hidden from users. Out of 43 page files, only ~35 have routes, and 9 major feature platforms are fully built but completely disconnected from the UI.

**Current User Access**: <20% of platform capabilities
**Target After Reconnection**: >95% of platform capabilities

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions:
1. âœ… **COMPLETED**: All 10 SDs created in database
2. **NEXT**: Review SDs in EHG_Engineer dashboard at http://localhost:3000
3. **REQUIRED**: LEAD approval for each SD (starting with CRITICAL priority)
4. **WORKFLOW**: Execute LEADâ†’PLANâ†’EXEC for approved SDs
5. **TRACKING**: Monitor progress via dashboard

### LEAD Phase Actions:
- Review business value and strategic alignment
- Prioritize based on user impact
- Approve SDs for PLAN phase
- Use `/leo-quick` or `/leo` for sub-agent analysis

### PLAN Phase Actions:
- Create detailed PRDs for each SD
- Design technical approach
- Create acceptance test plans
- Prepare for EXEC handoff

### EXEC Phase Actions:
- Implement routes and navigation
- Integrate disconnected features
- Validate functionality
- Update documentation
