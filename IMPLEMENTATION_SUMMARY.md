## 🎯 Integration Status

### LEAD Role (MANDATORY)

**From CLAUDE.md line 93-94**:
```markdown
**🤖 MANDATORY SUB-AGENT AUTOMATION**: Before approving any SD as complete,
LEAD MUST run `node scripts/complete-sd.js <SD_UUID>`. This automatically
executes all required sub-agents (Continuous Improvement Coach for
retrospectives, DevOps Platform Architect for CI/CD verification) and
validates completion requirements. Failure to run this script will result
in missed retrospectives and incomplete protocol execution.

**✅ APPROVAL CHECKLIST**: LEAD may only approve an SD after:
(1) Running `complete-sd.js` successfully,
(2) Verifying output shows "✅ SD READY FOR COMPLETION",
(3) Reviewing any warnings,
(4) Obtaining human approval for status change.
```

## 🚀 How It Works Now

### Before (The Problem)
```
LEAD approves SD
  ↓
❌ No retrospective (forgot)
❌ No DevOps check (forgot)
❌ No validation (forgot)
  ↓
Protocol incomplete
Learnings lost
```

### After (The Solution)
```
LEAD runs: node scripts/complete-sd.js <SD_UUID>
  ↓
✅ Auto-generates retrospective
✅ Auto-runs DevOps verification
✅ Auto-validates requirements
  ↓
Shows: "✅ SD READY FOR COMPLETION"
  ↓
LEAD can now approve confidently
```

## 🎓 What LEAD Needs to Know

### The Single Command

```bash
node scripts/complete-sd.js <SD_UUID>
```

**That's it!** This one command:
1. Runs all required sub-agents automatically
2. Generates retrospective
3. Checks CI/CD status
4. Validates all requirements
5. Tells you if SD is ready for approval

### The Approval Process

**Step 1**: Run the command
**Step 2**: Look for "✅ SD READY FOR COMPLETION"
**Step 3**: Review any warnings
**Step 4**: Get human approval
**Step 5**: Mark SD as complete in dashboard

### If Something Goes Wrong

**Script fails?**
- Read the error message
- Fix the issue
- Re-run the script

**Warnings shown?**
- Review each warning
- Determine if blocking or not
- Document decision

**Can't find the command?**
- Check you're in `/mnt/c/_EHG/EHG_Engineer`
- Verify script exists: `ls scripts/complete-sd.js`
- Read docs: `docs/AUTOMATION_COMPLETE.md`
