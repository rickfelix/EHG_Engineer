/**
 * Invariant Gauges Registry (SD-LEO-INFRA-INVARIANT-GAUGES-FRAMEWORK-001)
 *
 * A shared registry of silent-drift invariants, replacing the bespoke-one-off-gauge pattern
 * (e.g. scripts/gauge-unranked-claimable-leaves.mjs) with ONE runner (scripts/gauge-runner.mjs)
 * that executes every ENABLED entry on a cadence. Mirrors lib/governance/guardrail-registry.js's
 * shape (an array of objects carrying a function reference) rather than a DB table -- a table
 * cannot cleanly hold a `detectorFn` reference, and this is fundamentally code-config, not data.
 *
 * STUB-ROW ADOPTION CONTRACT: an invariant whose detector doesn't exist yet (its own SD hasn't
 * shipped) registers here as a STUB: `detectorFn: null, enabled: false`. This reserves the
 * registry slot and documents the owner/remediation/prevent story WITHOUT depending on the
 * sibling SD shipping first (no build-order deadlock). When the sibling SD ships its detector,
 * adoption is TWO ADDITIVE edits, neither structural: (1) in THIS file, set `detectorFn` to the
 * new string key and flip `enabled: true`; (2) in scripts/gauge-runner.mjs's
 * buildDetectorResolvers(), add one new `'<key>': async () => {...}` entry mapping that string key
 * to the real detector call. The runner's alerting/heartbeat/budget/skip-on-missing-resolver
 * machinery is untouched either way -- a half-adopted stub (registry flipped, resolver not yet
 * added) is skipped non-fatally, never breaks a run.
 *
 * Entry shape:
 *   id            — stable slug, used in GAUGE lines and findings
 *   name          — human-readable label
 *   detectorFn    — a STRING KEY resolved by gauge-runner.mjs's buildDetectorResolvers() map, so
 *                   the registry stays a plain, inspectable/serializable data structure rather than
 *                   embedding live function references, or `null` for a stub entry with no detector
 *                   yet.
 *   thresholdConfig — { tripWhen: (result) => boolean } — when true, the runner routes a finding
 *   ownerRole     — who a tripped finding is routed to (adam | solomon | coordinator | chairman)
 *   remediation   — what to do when this invariant fires
 *   prevent       — the durable fix that would retire this gauge entirely
 *   enabled       — false for stub entries
