# CORE CONTEXT (Essential)

## Session Prologue (Short)

1. **Follow LEAD‚ÜíPLAN‚ÜíEXEC** - Target ‚â•85% gate pass rate
2. **Use sub-agents** - Architect, QA, Reviewer - summarize outputs
3. **Database-first** - No markdown files as source of truth
4. **USE PROCESS SCRIPTS** - ‚ö†Ô∏è NEVER bypass add-prd-to-database.js, unified-handoff-system.js ‚ö†Ô∏è
5. **Small PRs** - Target ‚â§100 lines, max 400 with justification
6. **Priority-first** - Use `npm run prio:top3` to justify work

*For copy-paste version: see `templates/session-prologue.md` (generate via `npm run session:prologue`)*

## üèóÔ∏è Application Architecture - CRITICAL CONTEXT

### Two Distinct Applications:
1. **EHG_Engineer** (Management Dashboard) - WHERE YOU ARE NOW
   - **Path**: `/mnt/c/_EHG/EHG_Engineer/`
   - **Purpose**: LEO Protocol dashboard for managing Strategic Directives & PRDs
   - **Database**: dedlbzhpgkmetvhbkyzq (Supabase)
   - **GitHub**: https://github.com/rickfelix/EHG_Engineer.git
   - **Port**: 3000-3001
   - **Role**: MANAGEMENT TOOL ONLY - no customer features here!

2. **EHG** (Business Application) - IMPLEMENTATION TARGET
   - **Path**: `/mnt/c/_EHG/ehg/`
   - **Purpose**: The actual customer-facing business application
   - **Database**: liapbndqlqxdcgpwntbv (Supabase)
   - **GitHub**: https://github.com/rickfelix/ehg.git
   - **Built with**: Vite + React + Shadcn + TypeScript
   - **Role**: WHERE ALL FEATURES GET IMPLEMENTED

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: During EXEC Phase Implementation
1. **Read PRD** from EHG_Engineer database
2. **Navigate** to `/mnt/c/_EHG/ehg/` for implementation
3. **Make code changes** in EHG application (NOT in EHG_Engineer!)
4. **Push changes** to EHG's GitHub repo: `rickfelix/ehg.git`
5. **Track progress** in EHG_Engineer dashboard

### üîÑ Workflow Relationship
```
EHG_Engineer (Management)          EHG App (Implementation)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Strategic Directives     ‚Üí     Features implemented here
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PRDs                     ‚Üí     Code changes made here
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Progress Tracking        ‚Üê     Results verified from here
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Dashboard Views          ‚Üê     No changes here!
```

## Execution Philosophy

## üß† EXECUTION PHILOSOPHY (Read First!)

These principles override default behavior and must be internalized before starting work:

### Quality-First (PARAMOUNT)
**Get it right, not fast.** Correctness and completeness are MORE IMPORTANT than speed.
- Take the time needed to understand requirements fully
- Verify BEFORE implementing, test BEFORE claiming completion
- 2-4 hours of careful implementation beats 6-12 hours of rework
- If rushing leads to mistakes, you haven't saved time - you've wasted it
- "Done right" > "Done fast" - ALWAYS

### Testing-First (MANDATORY)
**Build confidence through comprehensive testing.**
- E2E testing is MANDATORY, not optional
- 30-60 minute investment saves 4-6 hours of rework
- 100% user story coverage required
- Both unit tests AND E2E tests must pass
- Tests are not overhead - they ARE the work

### Database-First (REQUIRED)
**Zero markdown files.** Database tables are single source of truth.
- SDs ‚Üí `strategic_directives_v2`
- PRDs ‚Üí `product_requirements_v2`
- Handoffs ‚Üí `sd_phase_handoffs`
- Retrospectives ‚Üí `retrospectives`
- Sub-agent results ‚Üí `sub_agent_execution_results`

### Validation-First (GATEKEEPING)
**Thorough validation BEFORE approval, full commitment AFTER.**
- LEAD validates: Real problem? Feasible solution? Resources available?
- After LEAD approval: SCOPE LOCK - deliver what was approved
- Exception: Critical blocker + human approval + new SD for deferred work

### Context-Aware (PROACTIVE)
**Monitor token usage proactively throughout execution.**
- Report context health in EVERY handoff
- HEALTHY (<70%), WARNING (70-90%), CRITICAL (90-95%), EMERGENCY (>95%)
- Use `/context-compact` when approaching WARNING threshold

### Application-Aware (VERIFICATION)
**Verify directory BEFORE writing ANY code.**
- `cd /mnt/c/_EHG/ehg && pwd` for customer features
- `git remote -v` to confirm correct repository
- Wrong directory = STOP immediately

### Evidence-Based (PROOF REQUIRED)
**Screenshot, test, verify. Claims without evidence are rejected.**
- Screenshot BEFORE and AFTER changes
- Test results with pass/fail counts
- CI/CD pipeline status (green checks required)
- Sub-agent verification results in database

**REMEMBER**: The goal is NOT to complete SDs quickly. The goal is to complete SDs CORRECTLY. A properly implemented SD that takes 8 hours is infinitely better than a rushed implementation that takes 4 hours but requires 6 hours of fixes.


## üîÑ Git Commit Guidelines

**Git Commit Guidelines**: `<type>(<SD-ID>): <subject>` format MANDATORY

**Required**: Type (feat/fix/docs/etc), SD-ID scope, imperative subject, AI attribution in footer
**Timing**: After checklist items, before context switches, at logical breakpoints
**Branch Strategy**: `eng/` prefix for EHG_Engineer, standard prefixes for EHG app features
**Size**: <100 lines ideal, <200 max

**Full Guidelines**: See `docs/03_protocols_and_standards/leo_git_commit_guidelines_v4.2.0.md`

## Database Operations - One Table at a Time

### REQUIRED: Database Operations Only

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: One Table at a Time**
- When manipulating Supabase tables, **ALWAYS operate on ONE table at a time**
- Batch operations across multiple tables often fail or cause inconsistencies
- Complete each table operation fully before moving to the next table
- Verify success after each table operation before proceeding

**Strategic Directives**:
- ‚úÖ Create in `strategic_directives_v2` table
- ‚úÖ Use `scripts/create-strategic-directive.js` or dashboard
- ‚úÖ ALL SD data must be in database, not files
- ‚úÖ **One SD insertion at a time** - verify before next

**PRDs (Product Requirements)**:
- ‚úÖ Create in `product_requirements_v2` table
- ‚úÖ Use `scripts/add-prd-to-database.js`
- ‚úÖ Link to SD via `strategic_directive_id` foreign key
- ‚úÖ **One PRD insertion at a time** - verify before next

**Retrospectives**:
- ‚úÖ Create in `retrospectives` table
- ‚úÖ Use `scripts/generate-comprehensive-retrospective.js`
- ‚úÖ Trigger: Continuous Improvement Coach sub-agent
- ‚úÖ Link to SD via `sd_id` foreign key
- ‚úÖ **One retrospective at a time** - verify before next

**Handoffs**:
- ‚úÖ Store in handoff tracking tables
- ‚úÖ 7-element structure required
- ‚úÖ Link to SD and phase
- ‚úÖ **One handoff at a time** - verify before next

**Progress & Verification**:
- ‚úÖ Update database fields directly
- ‚úÖ Store verification results in database
- ‚úÖ Track in real-time via dashboard
- ‚úÖ **One record update at a time** - verify before next

## üìä Communication & Context

### Communication Style

**Brief by Default**: Responses should be concise and action-oriented unless the user explicitly requests detailed explanations.

**When to be Brief** (default):
- Status updates and progress reports
- Acknowledging commands or requests
- Confirming successful operations
- Error messages (summary + fix)
- Tool invocation descriptions

**When to be Verbose** (only if requested):
- User asks "explain in detail"
- User requests "comprehensive" or "thorough" analysis
- Teaching or knowledge transfer scenarios
- Complex debugging requiring full context
- Documentation generation

**Examples**:

| Context | ‚ùå Verbose (unnecessary) | ‚úÖ Brief (preferred) |
|---------|------------------------|---------------------|
| File created | "I have successfully created the file at the specified path with all the requested content..." | "File created: path/to/file.md" |
| Test passed | "The test suite has been executed and all tests have passed successfully with 100% coverage..." | "‚úÖ Tests passed (100% coverage)" |
| Next step | "Now I will proceed to the next step which involves updating the database schema..." | "Updating database schema..." |

### Context Economy Rules

**Core Principles**:
- **Response Budget**: ‚â§500 tokens default (unless complexity requires more)
- **Summarize > Paste**: Reference paths/links instead of full content
- **Fetch-on-Demand**: Name files first, retrieve only needed parts
- **Running Summaries**: Keep condensed handoff/PR descriptions

### Best Practices

**Efficient Context Usage**:
- **Quote selectively**: Show only relevant lines with context
- **Use file:line references**: `src/component.js:42-58` instead of full file
- **Batch related reads**: Minimize round-trips when exploring
- **Archive verbosity**: Move details to handoffs/database, not conversation

### Examples

| ‚ùå Inefficient | ‚úÖ Efficient |
|----------------|--------------|
| Paste entire 500-line file | Quote lines 42-58 with `...` markers |
| Read file multiple times | Batch read relevant sections once |
| Repeat full error in response | Summarize error + reference line |
| Include all test output | Show failed tests + counts only |

### üîÑ MANDATORY: Server Restart Protocol
After ANY code changes:
1. **Kill the dev server**: `kill [PID]` or Ctrl+C
2. **Restart the server**: `npm run dev` or appropriate command
3. **Wait for ready message**: Confirm server is fully started
4. **Hard refresh browser**: Ctrl+Shift+R / Cmd+Shift+R
5. **Verify changes are live**: Test the new functionality

**WHY**: Dev servers may cache components, especially new files. Hot reload is NOT always reliable.

## Parallel Execution

**When to Use**: Modern AI supports parallel tool execution for independent operations. Use conservatively.

**Safe for Parallel Execution**:
- ‚úÖ Reading multiple independent files for analysis
- ‚úÖ Running multiple independent database queries
- ‚úÖ Executing multiple read-only Git commands (status, log, diff)
- ‚úÖ Multiple WebFetch calls to different URLs
- ‚úÖ Batch file searches (multiple Glob operations)

**NOT Safe for Parallel Execution**:
- ‚ùå Write operations (Edit, Write tools)
- ‚ùå Database mutations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- ‚ùå Any operations where order matters
- ‚ùå Operations that depend on each other's results
- ‚ùå Git operations that modify state (commit, push, merge)

**Critical Constraint**: Context sharing between parallel operations is limited. Each operation receives the same initial context but cannot see other parallel operations' results until they all complete.

**Example Use Case**:
```
"Read the following 3 files for analysis:"
- Read src/component.tsx
- Read src/types.ts
- Read tests/component.test.tsx
```

**Anti-Pattern**:
```
"Read file A, then based on what you find, read file B"
(Must be sequential - second read depends on first)
```

## Quick Reference

## üìã QUICK REFERENCE

### Component Sizing

| Lines of Code | Action | Rationale |
|---------------|--------|-----------|
| <200 | Consider combining | Too granular |
| **300-600** | ‚úÖ **OPTIMAL** | Sweet spot for testing & maintenance |
| >800 | **MUST split** | Too complex, hard to test |

### Git Commits (Conventional Commits)

**Format**: `<type>(<SD-ID>): <subject>`

```bash
git commit -m "feat(SD-XXX): Brief description

Detailed explanation of changes.

ü§ñ Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"
```

**Types**: feat, fix, docs, refactor, test, chore, perf

### Server Restart (After ANY Changes)

```bash
# Kill
pkill -f "node server.js"

# Build (if UI changes)
npm run build:client

# Restart
PORT=3000 node server.js

# Hard refresh browser
# Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) / Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
```

### Parallel Execution (Save Time)

**When Safe**:
- ‚úÖ Multiple independent file reads
- ‚úÖ Multiple database queries (read-only)
- ‚úÖ Sub-agent execution (different domains)

**NOT Safe**:
- ‚ùå Write operations
- ‚ùå Database mutations
- ‚ùå Sequential dependencies

**Example**:
```bash
# LEAD Pre-Approval: 4 sub-agents in parallel
node scripts/systems-analyst-codebase-audit.js <SD-ID> &
node scripts/database-architect-schema-review.js <SD-ID> &
node scripts/security-architect-assessment.js <SD-ID> &
node scripts/design-subagent-evaluation.js <SD-ID> &
wait

# Reduces time from 2 minutes sequential to 30 seconds parallel
```

### Context Efficiency Patterns

```javascript
// ‚ùå Inefficient
const { data } = await supabase.from('table').select('*');
console.log(data); // Dumps full JSON

// ‚úÖ Efficient
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('table')
  .select('id, title, status')
  .limit(5);
console.log(`Found ${data.length} items`);
```

### Database Operations (One at a Time)

**CRITICAL**: When manipulating Supabase tables, operate on ONE table at a time.

```javascript
// ‚ùå Bad: Batch across tables
await Promise.all([
  supabase.from('table1').insert(data1),
  supabase.from('table2').insert(data2)
]);

// ‚úÖ Good: Sequential, one table at a time
await supabase.from('table1').insert(data1);
// Verify success
await supabase.from('table2').insert(data2);
// Verify success
```

### Sub-Agent Orchestration

**Automated** (preferred):
```bash
# Orchestrator runs all required sub-agents for phase
node scripts/orchestrate-phase-subagents.js <PHASE> <SD-ID>

# Phases: LEAD_PRE_APPROVAL, PLAN_PRD, EXEC_IMPL, PLAN_VERIFY, LEAD_FINAL
```

**Manual** (if needed):
```bash
# QA Director
node scripts/qa-engineering-director-enhanced.js <SD-ID> --full-e2e

# GitHub Actions
node scripts/github-actions-verifier.js <SD-ID>

# Database Architect
node scripts/database-architect-schema-review.js <SD-ID>
```

### Testing Commands

```bash
# Unit tests (business logic)
npm run test:unit

# E2E tests (user flows)
npm run test:e2e

# Both (MANDATORY before EXEC‚ÜíPLAN handoff)
npm run test:unit && npm run test:e2e
```

### Handoff Creation

```bash
# Unified handoff system (with auto sub-agent orchestration)
node scripts/unified-handoff-system.js execute <TYPE> <SD-ID>

# Types:
# - LEAD-to-PLAN
# - PLAN-to-EXEC
# - EXEC-to-PLAN (auto-runs PLAN_VERIFY sub-agents)
# - PLAN-to-LEAD (auto-runs LEAD_FINAL sub-agents)
```

### Progress Verification

```bash
# Check progress breakdown
node -e "
const { createClient } = require('@supabase/supabase-js');
const supabase = createClient(process.env.SUPABASE_URL, process.env.SUPABASE_ANON_KEY);
(async () => {
  const { data } = await supabase.rpc('get_progress_breakdown', { sd_id_param: 'SD-XXX' });
  console.log(JSON.stringify(data, null, 2));
})();
"
```

## üîß CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW

**Development Workflow**: MANDATORY server restart after ANY changes

**Steps**: Kill server ‚Üí Build client (`npm run build:client`) ‚Üí Restart server ‚Üí Hard refresh browser
**Why**: No hot-reloading configured, dist/ serves compiled files
**Commands**: `pkill -f "node server.js" && npm run build:client && PORT=3000 node server.js`

**Complete Guide**: See `docs/reference/development-workflow.md`

# EXEC PHASE CONTEXT

## Strategic Directive Execution Protocol

# STRATEGIC DIRECTIVE EXECUTION PROTOCOL

**When executing a Strategic Directive, follow this structured 5-phase workflow.**

## Target Application Selection

**CRITICAL FIRST STEP**: Determine which application this SD targets:

- **EHG** (`/mnt/c/_EHG/ehg/`) - Customer-facing features (MOST IMPLEMENTATIONS)
  - Database: liapbndqlqxdcgpwntbv (Supabase)
  - GitHub: rickfelix/ehg.git
  - Stack: Vite + React + Shadcn + TypeScript

- **EHG_Engineer** (`/mnt/c/_EHG/EHG_Engineer/`) - LEO Protocol dashboard/tooling ONLY
  - Database: dedlbzhpgkmetvhbkyzq (Supabase)
  - GitHub: rickfelix/EHG_Engineer.git
  - Role: Management tool, no customer features

## Priority Tiers

- **CRITICAL** (90+): Business-critical, immediate action required
- **HIGH** (70-89): Important features, near-term priority
- **MEDIUM** (50-69): Standard enhancements, planned work
- **LOW** (30-49): Nice-to-have improvements

## Workflow Overview

Execute in order: **LEAD PRE-APPROVAL ‚Üí PLAN PRD ‚Üí EXEC IMPLEMENTATION ‚Üí PLAN VERIFICATION ‚Üí LEAD FINAL APPROVAL**

Each phase has:
- Assigned agent (LEAD/PLAN/EXEC)
- Percentage allocation
- Required sub-agents
- Exit criteria
- Mandatory handoff

See detailed phase sections below.

## 5-Phase Strategic Directive Workflow

## üéØ 5-PHASE STRATEGIC DIRECTIVE WORKFLOW

Total: 100% = LEAD (35%) + PLAN (35%) + EXEC (30%)

---

### PHASE 1: LEAD PRE-APPROVAL (20% of LEAD allocation)

**Agent**: Strategic Leadership Agent (LEAD)
**Purpose**: Strategic validation, business alignment, feasibility assessment
**Duration**: 1-2 hours

**Mandatory Sub-Agents**:
- Principal Systems Analyst (duplicate check, existing implementation)
- Principal Database Architect (if database keywords in scope)
- Chief Security Architect (if security keywords in scope)
- Senior Design Sub-Agent (if UI/UX keywords in scope)

**Execution**: Run in parallel to save time
```bash
# Parallel execution
node scripts/systems-analyst-codebase-audit.js <SD-ID> &
node scripts/database-architect-schema-review.js <SD-ID> &
node scripts/security-architect-assessment.js <SD-ID> &
node scripts/design-subagent-evaluation.js <SD-ID> &
wait
```

**Deliverables**:
- SD approved or rejected with feedback
- Strategic Validation gate passed
- Over-engineering rubric applied (if needed)
- LEAD‚ÜíPLAN handoff created

**Exit Criteria**:
- SD status = 'active'
- Strategic Validation gate passed (6 questions answered)
- No critical blockers identified
- Handoff stored in `sd_phase_handoffs`

---

### PHASE 2: PLAN PRD CREATION (20% of PLAN allocation)

**Agent**: Technical Planning Agent (PLAN)
**Purpose**: Technical design, PRD creation, test planning
**Duration**: 2-4 hours

**Mandatory Sub-Agents**:
- Principal Database Architect (MANDATORY for ALL SDs - database validation)
- Product Requirements Expert (auto-generates user stories)

**Execution**: Sequential (each informs next)
```bash
# Step 1: Database validation
node scripts/database-architect-schema-review.js <SD-ID>

# Step 2: User story generation (automatic)
# Triggered by PRD creation, stores in user_stories table

# Step 3: Component sizing (if UI/UX SD)
node scripts/design-subagent-evaluation.js <SD-ID>
```

**Deliverables**:
- PRD created in `product_requirements_v2` table
- User stories in `user_stories` table (100% mapped to E2E tests)
- Component architecture defined (300-600 LOC per component)
- Database migrations planned (if needed)
- PLAN‚ÜíEXEC handoff created

**Exit Criteria**:
- PRD exists with comprehensive test plan
- User stories generated and validated
- Database dependencies resolved or escalated
- Handoff stored in `sd_phase_handoffs`

---

### PHASE 3: EXEC IMPLEMENTATION (30% of EXEC allocation)

**Agent**: Implementation Agent (EXEC)
**Purpose**: Code implementation, testing, delivery
**Duration**: 4-8 hours

**Mandatory Sub-Agents**:
- None (EXEC does the work directly)

**Pre-Implementation Checklist**:
```markdown
## EXEC Pre-Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Application: [EHG or EHG_Engineer - VERIFIED via pwd]
- [ ] GitHub remote: [verified via git remote -v]
- [ ] URL: [exact URL from PRD - accessible: YES/NO]
- [ ] Component: [path/to/component]
- [ ] Screenshot: [BEFORE state captured]
```

**Post-Implementation Requirements**:
1. **Server Restart** (MANDATORY for UI changes)
   ```bash
   pkill -f "node server.js"
   npm run build:client  # If UI changes
   PORT=3000 node server.js
   # Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R
   ```

2. **Git Commit** (Conventional Commits with SD-ID)
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat(<SD-ID>): Brief description

   Detailed explanation.

   ü§ñ Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)

   Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"
   ```

3. **Dual Test Execution** (MANDATORY - BOTH types)
   ```bash
   npm run test:unit      # Business logic
   npm run test:e2e       # User flows
   ```

4. **Wait for CI/CD** (2-3 minutes)
   ```bash
   gh run list --limit 5  # All green ‚úÖ
   ```

**Deliverables**:
- Implementation complete
- Unit tests pass
- E2E tests pass (100% user story coverage)
- CI/CD pipelines green
- Documentation generated
- EXEC‚ÜíPLAN handoff created

**Exit Criteria**:
- All PRD requirements implemented
- Both test types passing
- CI/CD green
- Documentation exists in `generated_docs`
- **Branch lifecycle clean** (see below)
- Handoff stored in `sd_phase_handoffs`

**Branch Lifecycle Verification** (AUTOMATED):
The GITHUB sub-agent (DevOps Platform Architect) automatically verifies:

‚úÖ **No uncommitted changes** - All work committed
- ‚ùå **BLOCKING**: Uncommitted changes prevent handoff creation
- Fix: Commit or stash changes before handoff

‚úÖ **No unpushed commits** - Branch synced with remote
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  **WARNING**: Unpushed commits lower confidence to 75%
- Fix: Push commits to remote before handoff

‚úÖ **Minimal unmerged branches** - Clean branch hygiene
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  **WARNING**: 5+ unmerged branches lower confidence to 80%
- Fix: Merge or delete stale branches

‚ÑπÔ∏è  **Stale branches detected** - Cleanup recommendation
- Info only: Branches 30+ days old without commits
- Recommendation: Delete or update stale branches

**Automated Enforcement**:
- Runs automatically during EXEC‚ÜíPLAN and PLAN‚ÜíLEAD handoff creation
- Results stored in `sub_agent_execution_results` table
- Critical issues (uncommitted changes) BLOCK handoff
- Warnings reduce confidence score but don't block

---

### PHASE 4: PLAN SUPERVISOR VERIFICATION (15% of PLAN allocation)

**Agent**: Technical Planning Agent (PLAN) in supervisor mode
**Purpose**: Verification, quality assurance, sub-agent orchestration
**Duration**: 1-2 hours

## üö® EXEC Agent Implementation Requirements

### MANDATORY Pre-Implementation Verification
Before writing ANY code, EXEC MUST:

0. **AMBIGUITY RESOLUTION** üîç CRITICAL FIRST STEP
   - Review PRD for unclear requirements, missing details, or conflicting specifications
   - Do NOT proceed with implementation if ANY ambiguity exists
   - Use 3-tier escalation to resolve:
     1. **Re-read PRD**: Check acceptance_criteria, functional_requirements, test_scenarios
     2. **Query database context**: Check user stories, implementation_context, SD strategic_objectives
     3. **Ask user**: Use AskUserQuestion tool with specific, focused questions
   - Document resolution: "Ambiguity in [area] resolved via [method]: [resolution]"
   - **If still unclear after escalation**: BLOCK implementation and await user clarification

**Common Ambiguities to Watch For**:
- Vague feature descriptions ("improve UX", "make it better")
- Missing edge case handling ("what if user inputs invalid data?")
- Unclear success criteria ("should be fast", "should look good")
- Conflicting requirements between PRD sections
- Undefined behavior for error states

**Example Ambiguity Resolution**:
```
‚ùå BAD: Guess at implementation based on similar feature
‚úÖ GOOD:
  - Tier 1: Re-read PRD section 3.2 ‚Üí Still unclear on validation rules
  - Tier 2: Query user_stories table ‚Üí Found implementation_context with validation spec
  - Resolution: "Email validation will use regex pattern from US-002 context"
```

1. **APPLICATION CHECK** ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL
   - Confirm target app: `/mnt/c/_EHG/ehg/` (NOT EHG_Engineer!)
   - Verify: `cd /mnt/c/_EHG/ehg && pwd` should show `/mnt/c/_EHG/ehg`
   - Check GitHub: `git remote -v` should show `rickfelix/ehg.git`
   - If you're in EHG_Engineer, you're in the WRONG place for implementation!

2. **URL Verification** ‚úÖ
   - Navigate to the EXACT URL specified in the PRD
   - Confirm the page loads and is accessible
   - Take a screenshot for evidence
   - Document: "Verified: [URL] is accessible"

3. **Component Identification** üéØ
   - Identify the exact file path of the target component
   - Confirm component exists at specified location
   - Document: "Target component: [full/path/to/component.tsx]"

4. **Application Context** üìÅ
   - Verify correct application directory
   - Confirm port number matches PRD
   - Document: "Application: [/path/to/app] on port [XXXX]"

5. **Visual Confirmation** üì∏
   - Screenshot current state BEFORE changes
   - Identify exact location for new features
   - Document: "Current state captured, changes will go at [location]"

### Implementation Checklist Template

- [ ] **Application verified**: [/mnt/c/_EHG/ehg/ confirmed]
- [ ] **URL verified**: [exact URL from PRD]
- [ ] **Page accessible**: [YES/NO]
- [ ] **Component identified**: [path/to/component]
- [ ] **Port confirmed**: [port number]
- [ ] **Screenshot taken**: [timestamp]
- [ ] **Target location confirmed**: [where changes go]
```

### Common Mistakes to AVOID
- ‚ùå Assuming component location based on naming similarity
- ‚ùå Implementing without navigating to the URL first
- ‚ùå Ignoring port numbers in URLs
- ‚ùå Pattern matching without verification
- ‚ùå Starting to code before completing checklist
- ‚ùå Not restarting dev servers after changes
- ‚ùå **CRITICAL**: Creating files for PRDs, handoffs, or documentation
- ‚ùå **CRITICAL**: Proceeding with implementation when requirements are ambiguous

## Sub-Agent Parallel Execution

**Overview**: Sub-agents are independent specialists. When multiple sub-agents provide non-overlapping assessments, call them in parallel to reduce latency.

**When Parallel Execution is Beneficial**:

1. **LEAD Initial Assessment**
   - Parallel: Security Architect + Database Architect + Business Analyst
   - Why: Each evaluates different aspects of an SD (security posture, data model feasibility, business alignment)
   - Context sharing: Not required - each has independent assessment criteria

2. **PLAN Supervisor Verification**
   - Parallel: QA Director + Security Architect + Performance Lead + Database Architect
   - Why: Final "done done" check across all quality dimensions simultaneously
   - Context sharing: Not required - each validates their domain independently

3. **EXEC Pre-Implementation Checks**
   - Parallel: Systems Analyst (duplicate check) + Security Architect (auth requirements) + Database Architect (schema changes)
   - Why: Gather all constraints before coding begins
   - Context sharing: Not required - each identifies risks independently

**When Sequential Execution is Required**:

- ‚ùå One sub-agent's output feeds another's input
- ‚ùå Database schema must be reviewed before security assessment
- ‚ùå Any workflow where order creates dependencies

**Implementation Pattern**:

```javascript
// ‚úÖ Parallel - Independent assessments
const results = await Promise.all([
  callSubAgent('security-architect', sd_id),
  callSubAgent('database-architect', sd_id),
  callSubAgent('qa-director', sd_id)
]);

// ‚ùå Sequential - One depends on another
const schema = await callSubAgent('database-architect', sd_id);
const securityReview = await callSubAgent('security-architect', schema); // Needs schema first
```

**Critical Constraints**:
- Each sub-agent receives the same initial context
- Sub-agents cannot see each other's results until all complete
- Aggregate results AFTER all sub-agents finish
- If any sub-agent fails, gracefully handle in aggregation phase

**Benefits**:
- Reduces total verification time (4 sub-agents in 30s vs. 2min sequential)
- No context sharing limitations since assessments are independent
- Each specialist works from fresh context without bias from others

## TODO Comment Standard

## TODO Comment Standard (When Deferring Work)

**Evidence from Retrospectives**: Proven pattern in SD-UAT-003 saved 4-6 hours.

### Standard TODO Format

```typescript
// TODO (SD-ID): Action required
// Requires: Dependencies, prerequisites
// Estimated effort: X-Y hours
// Current state: Mock/temporary/placeholder
```

**Success Pattern** (SD-UAT-003):
> "Comprehensive TODO comments provided clear future work path. Saved 4-6 hours."

## EXEC Dual Test Requirement

## EXEC Dual Test Requirement


### ‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY: Dual Test Execution

**CRITICAL**: "Smoke tests" means BOTH test types, not just one!

**Evidence**: SD-EXPORT-001 - Tests existed but weren't executed. 30-minute gap between "complete" and validation. SD-EVA-MEETING-002 - 67% E2E failure rate when finally run.

Before creating EXEC‚ÜíPLAN handoff, EXEC MUST run:

#### 1. Unit Tests (Business Logic Validation)
```bash
cd /mnt/c/_EHG/ehg
npm run test:unit
```
- **What it validates**: Service layer, business logic, data transformations
- **Failure means**: Core functionality is broken
- **Required for**: EXEC‚ÜíPLAN handoff
- **Framework**: Vitest

#### 2. E2E Tests (UI/Integration Validation)
```bash
cd /mnt/c/_EHG/ehg
npm run test:e2e
```
- **What it validates**: User flows, component rendering, integration
- **Failure means**: User-facing features don't work
- **Required for**: EXEC‚ÜíPLAN handoff
- **Framework**: Playwright

#### Verification Checklist
- [ ] Unit tests executed: `npm run test:unit`
- [ ] Unit tests passed: [X/X tests]
- [ ] E2E tests executed: `npm run test:e2e`
- [ ] E2E tests passed: [X/X tests]
- [ ] Both test types documented in EXEC‚ÜíPLAN handoff
- [ ] Screenshots captured for E2E test evidence
- [ ] Test results included in handoff "Deliverables Manifest"

**‚ùå BLOCKING**: Cannot create EXEC‚ÜíPLAN handoff without BOTH test types passing.

**Common Mistakes** (from SD-EXPORT-001):
- ‚ùå "Tests exist" ‚â† "Tests passed"
- ‚ùå Running only E2E tests and claiming "all tests passed"
- ‚ùå Marking SD complete before running any tests
- ‚ùå Creating handoff without test evidence documentation
- ‚úÖ Run BOTH unit AND E2E tests explicitly
- ‚úÖ Document pass/fail counts in handoff
- ‚úÖ Include screenshots for visual evidence

### Why This Matters
- **SD-EXPORT-001**: 30-minute gap between marking "complete" and discovering tests weren't run
- **SD-EVA-MEETING-002**: 67% E2E failure rate revealed only when tests finally executed
- **Impact**: Testing enforcement prevents claiming "done" without proof

## Testing Tier Strategy (Updated)


## Testing Requirements - Dual Test Execution (UPDATED)

**Philosophy**: Comprehensive testing = Unit tests (logic) + E2E tests (user experience)

### Tier 1: Smoke Tests (MANDATORY) ‚úÖ
- **Requirement**: BOTH unit tests AND E2E tests must pass
- **Commands**:
  - Unit: `npm run test:unit` (Vitest - business logic)
  - E2E: `npm run test:e2e` (Playwright - user flows)
- **Approval**: **BOTH test types REQUIRED for PLAN‚ÜíLEAD approval**
- **Execution Time**: Combined <5 minutes for smoke-level tests
- **Coverage**:
  - Unit: Service layer, business logic, utilities
  - E2E: Critical user paths, authentication, navigation

### Tier 2: Comprehensive Testing (RECOMMENDED) üìã
- **Requirement**: Full test suite with deep coverage
- **Commands**:
  - Unit: `npm run test:unit:coverage` (50%+ coverage target)
  - E2E: All Playwright tests (30-50 scenarios)
  - Integration: `npm run test:integration`
  - A11y: `npm run test:a11y`
- **Approval**: Nice to have, **NOT blocking** but highly recommended
- **Timing**: Can be refined post-deployment

### Tier 3: Manual Testing (SITUATIONAL) üîç
- **UI changes**: Visual regression testing
- **Complex flows**: Multi-step wizards, payment flows
- **Edge cases**: Rare scenarios not covered by automation

### ‚ö†Ô∏è What Changed (From Protocol Enhancement)
**Before**: "Tier 1 = 3-5 tests, <60s" (ambiguous - which tests?)
**After**: "Tier 1 = Unit tests + E2E tests (explicit frameworks, explicit commands)"

**Lesson Learned**: SD-AGENT-ADMIN-002 testing oversight (ran E2E only, missed unit test failures)
