Total: 1,794 LOC of production-ready observability infrastructure. **MISSING**: Role-based access controls, dedicated Operations nav section, unified alerting, cross-system analytics dashboard.`,

  scope: `**8-Week Observability Enhancement Implementation**:

**PHASE 1: Role-Based Access & Operations Grouping (Weeks 1-2)**
├── Create dedicated "Operations" navigation section
├── Move 4 observability pages from "Management" to "Operations"
├── Add role-based access control (Ops Manager, SRE, Security roles)
├── Implement permission guards for sensitive metrics
├── Add "Operations" badge with system health indicator
└── Target: Organized ops section with proper access controls

**PHASE 2: Unified Observability Dashboard (Weeks 3-4)**
├── Create /operations route with unified overview
├── Display real-time metrics from all 4 subsystems
├── Cross-system correlation engine (detect cascading issues)
├── AI-powered anomaly detection across monitoring/performance/security
├── Unified alerting dashboard with priority levels
└── Target: Single pane of glass for all operational data

**PHASE 3: AI-Powered Insights & Alerting (Weeks 5-6)**
├── Implement AIOperationalInsights component
├── Pattern detection: Performance degradation → Security events
├── Predictive alerting: Forecast capacity issues 7 days ahead
├── Smart alert routing based on severity and team availability
├── Auto-remediation suggestions for common issues
└── Target: Proactive operations with AI recommendations

**PHASE 4: Advanced Features & Integration (Weeks 7-8)**
├── Create OperationsCommandCenter component (war room view)
├── Incident timeline correlation across all systems
├── Export operational reports (PDF/Excel with charts)
├── Integration with external monitoring (Datadog, New Relic webhooks)
├── Mobile-responsive operations dashboard
├── SLA tracking and compliance reporting
└── Target: Enterprise-grade operations center

**Quick Wins (Week 1)**:
• Reorganize navigation → "Operations" section (2 hours)
• Add role-based guards to 4 pages (4 hours)
• Unified health indicator in nav badge (1 hour)`,

  strategic_objectives: [
    "Reorganize navigation to create dedicated 'Operations' section with 4 observability pages",
    "Implement role-based access controls (Ops Manager, SRE, Security Analyst, Developer roles)",
    "Build unified /operations dashboard with cross-system metrics and AI correlation",
    "Create AI-powered anomaly detection across monitoring, performance, security, and data quality",
    "Implement predictive alerting with 7-day capacity forecasting",
    "Build operations command center with incident timeline and war room view",
    "Add export capabilities for operational reports (PDF/Excel with charts)",
    "Integrate external monitoring platforms (Datadog, New Relic, PagerDuty)",
    "Create mobile-responsive operations dashboard for on-call teams"
  ],

  success_criteria: [
    "✅ Navigation shows 'Operations' section with 4 pages (Monitoring, Performance, Security, Data Management)",
    "✅ Role-based access enforced: Only users with Ops/SRE/Security roles can access pages",
    "✅ Permission denied pages show helpful message for unauthorized users",
    "✅ Unified /operations dashboard displays real-time metrics from all 4 subsystems",
    "✅ AI anomaly detection identifies 3+ correlation patterns (e.g., high DB load → slow API → more errors)",
    "✅ Predictive alerts forecast capacity issues 7+ days in advance with ≥85% accuracy",
    "✅ Operations command center displays incident timeline with cross-system correlation",
    "✅ Operational reports export as PDF/Excel with charts, tables, and recommendations",
    "✅ External monitoring integrations receive/send webhooks (Datadog, New Relic, PagerDuty)",
    "✅ Mobile dashboard accessible on tablets/phones with core metrics",
    "✅ SLA tracking shows 99.9%+ uptime with automated compliance reports",
    "✅ Auto-remediation suggests fixes for 10+ common operational issues"
  ],

  key_principles: [
    "**Reconnection Focus**: Leverage existing 1,794 LOC of observability infrastructure",
    "**Security First**: Role-based access prevents unauthorized metric viewing",
    "**Operations Excellence**: Single pane of glass for all operational data",
    "**Proactive AI**: Predict issues before they impact users",
    "**Enterprise Grade**: SLA tracking, compliance reports, external integrations",
    "**Mobile Ready**: On-call teams need mobile access to critical metrics",
    "**Quick Wins**: Navigation reorganization unlocks immediate value",
    "**Correlation Engine**: Cross-system insights reveal hidden patterns"
