// 1. Executive Summary
const executive_summary = `
LEAD PRE-APPROVAL COMPLETE - E2E Test Infrastructure Improvements

Strategic validation: 5/6 PASS (over-engineering risk identified)
Over-engineering score: 12/30 ACCEPTABLE

**Decision**: APPROVE with guidance to avoid over-engineering.

**Key Directive**: Focus on targeted, high-impact fixes using 80/20 rule. Avoid complex test frameworks or comprehensive rewrites.
`.trim();

// 2. Deliverables Manifest
const deliverables_manifest = `
**LEAD Phase Deliverables**:

1. **Strategic Validation** ✅
   - 6-question gate completed
   - Real problem validated (flaky tests reducing velocity)
   - Feasibility confirmed (standard Playwright patterns exist)
   - Resources available (1-2 week estimate)
   - Business alignment confirmed (developer velocity multiplier)
   - Timing appropriate (technical debt should be addressed)
   - Alternative consideration: Need targeted approach vs full rewrite

2. **Over-Engineering Assessment** ✅
   - Rubric score: 12/30 (ACCEPTABLE)
   - Primary risks: Scope creep (3/5), Feature bloat (3/5)
   - Mitigation: PLAN phase guidance provided

3. **Sub-Agent Validation** ✅ (Streamlined)
   - Database Architect: N/A (no schema changes)
   - Security Architect: N/A (test infrastructure)
   - Design Sub-Agent: N/A (no UI changes)
   - Systems Analyst: Deferred to PLAN (will audit existing test patterns)

4. **SD Type Classification** ✅
   - Classified as: infrastructure
   - Rationale: Improves existing test infrastructure, no UI/features
   - Validation path: Unit tests + verification (no E2E requirement per SD-INFRA-VALIDATION)
`.trim();

// 3. Completeness Report
const completeness_report = `
**Strategic Validation Results**:

✅ Q1: Real problem? YES - Flaky tests impacting velocity, confidence, and debugging time
✅ Q2: Feasible solution? YES - Known patterns for selector stability, timeout consistency, mock patterns
✅ Q3: Resources available? YES - 1-2 week infrastructure improvement, no blockers
✅ Q4: Business alignment? YES - Developer velocity multiplier, supports all features
✅ Q5: Right timing? YES - Technical debt compounds, high priority indicates urgency
⚠️  Q6: Simpler alternatives? NEEDS GUIDANCE - Risk of over-engineering vs targeted fixes

**Over-Engineering Assessment**:
- Scope Creep: 3/5 (needs boundaries)
- Technology Stack: 1/5 (uses existing Playwright)
- Abstraction Layers: 2/5 (monitor complexity)
- Premature Optimization: 1/5 (solving real pain)
- Feature Bloat: 3/5 (risk of "fix everything")
- Maintainability: 2/5 (should reduce burden if done right)
- **Total**: 12/30 ACCEPTABLE (threshold: ≤15/30)

**Gaps/Incomplete Items**:
- Specific pain points not quantified (how many tests flaky? which selectors fail most?)
- Proposed solution not yet defined (PLAN phase responsibility)
- Test infrastructure audit not completed (deferred to PLAN)
`.trim();

// 4. Key Decisions & Rationale
const key_decisions = `
**Decision 1: Approve with conditional guidance**
- Rationale: Problem is real but solution scope undefined
- Impact: PLAN phase must propose targeted approach, not comprehensive rewrite

**Decision 2: Classify as infrastructure SD**
- Rationale: No UI changes, improves existing test patterns
- Impact: Can complete with unit tests + verification (no E2E requirement)
- Reference: SD-INFRA-VALIDATION type-aware validation

**Decision 3: Skip database/security/design sub-agents**
- Rationale: No schema changes, no security implications, no UI
- Impact: Faster approval, focused validation
- Trade-off: PLAN must validate no hidden dependencies

**Decision 4: Emphasize 80/20 rule in guidance**
- Rationale: Test infrastructure rewrites often over-engineer
- Impact: Forces prioritization of high-impact fixes first
- Example: Fix top 5 flakiest tests before building framework

**Decision 5: Require quantification in PLAN phase**
- Rationale: "Flaky tests" is subjective without data
- Impact: PLAN must measure/quantify before proposing solution
- Metrics: Test failure rate, re-run frequency, time lost to debugging
`.trim();

// 5. Known Issues & Risks
const known_issues = `
**Known Risks**:

Risk 1: Over-engineering (Score: 3/5 scope + 3/5 bloat = HIGH)
- Status: IDENTIFIED
- Mitigation: Explicit PLAN guidance to use 80/20 rule, avoid frameworks
- Monitor: Component sizing (should be small focused utilities, not large frameworks)

Risk 2: Undefined solution scope
- Status: EXPECTED (PLAN phase responsibility)
- Mitigation: Require quantification before solution design
- Monitor: PRD should list specific pain points with evidence

Risk 3: Test infrastructure changes affecting all tests
- Status: MEDIUM
- Mitigation: Incremental rollout, backward compatibility required
- Monitor: PLAN should propose phased approach

**Warnings**:
- Do NOT create new test framework from scratch
- Do NOT attempt to fix every test issue in one SD
- DO focus on repeatable patterns, not one-off fixes

**Blockers**: None identified

// 6. Resource Utilization + Context Health
const resource_utilization = `
**Context Health**:
- Current Usage: ~120k tokens (60% of 200k budget)
- Status: 🟢 HEALTHY
- Buffer Remaining: 80k tokens
- Compaction Needed: NO

**Session Duration**: ~30 minutes (LEAD phase only)

**Sub-Agent Efficiency**:
- Skipped Database/Security/Design sub-agents (not applicable)
- Focused validation on strategic fit and over-engineering risk
- Time saved: ~15-20 minutes vs full sub-agent suite

**Resource Allocation**:
- LEAD phase: Complete (30 min)
- PLAN phase: Estimated 2-4 hours (PRD creation, test audit, user story generation)
- EXEC phase: Estimated 1-2 weeks (implementation)
`.trim();

// 7. Action Items for PLAN Agent
const action_items = `
**PLAN PRD CREATION PHASE (Phase 2) - Required Actions**:

1. **Quantify Current Pain Points** ⏳ (CRITICAL)
   - Measure test failure rate (% of runs that fail)
   - Identify top 10 most flaky tests
   - Calculate time lost to re-runs and debugging
   - Document specific selector issues (which elements? how often?)
   - Analyze timeout patterns (which tests? what duration?)

2. **Audit Existing Test Infrastructure** ⏳
   - Survey current selector strategies (data-testid vs classes vs text)
   - Review timeout patterns across test files
   - Catalog mock mode variations
   - Assess test data management approaches
   - Identify successful patterns to replicate

3. **Apply 80/20 Rule to Solution Design** ⏳ (CRITICAL)
   - Prioritize: Fix 20% of issues causing 80% of problems
   - Start with top 3-5 highest-impact improvements
   - Defer low-impact nice-to-haves to future SDs
   - Example: If 5 tests cause 70% of failures, fix those first

4. **Create PRD with Targeted Scope** ⏳
   - Define specific improvements (not "improve all tests")
   - Component sizing: 300-600 LOC per utility/pattern
   - Avoid: New test frameworks, complete rewrites
   - Favor: Simple patterns, documentation, refactoring

5. **Generate User Stories** ⏳
   - Auto-generated via PRD system
   - Focus on measurable outcomes (reduce failure rate by X%)
   - Include verification criteria

6. **Set SD Type** ⏳
   - Update strategic_directives_v2: sd_type = 'infrastructure'
   - Validation path: Unit tests + comprehensive verification

7. **Create PLAN→EXEC Handoff** ⏳
   - Use unified-handoff-system.js
   - Include quantified pain points and success criteria

**Success Criteria for PLAN Phase**:
- Pain points quantified with data (not anecdotes)
- Solution scope targeted to top 3-5 issues
- Component sizing appropriate (300-600 LOC)
- No new test frameworks proposed
- PRD quality ≥85%

**Estimated Time**: 2-4 hours
