# Codex Usage Analysis Report

**Date**: 2025-01-19
**Question**: "Does this prove that we are leveraging Codex?"

## Executive Summary

**Answer: NO** - The implementation does NOT prove actual Codex usage. It proves the **architecture is ready** for Codex, but Codex itself is not being leveraged.

## Key Findings

### 1. What Codex Is Supposed To Be
Based on the dual-lane architecture documentation:
- **Codex**: A separate AI agent (like Claude) that acts as the read-only "Builder"
- **Role**: Generate patches, create artifacts, commit to staging branches
- **Restrictions**: Read-only database access, no write permissions
- **Output**: Patch bundles with [CODEX-READY] markers

### 2. What Actually Exists

#### ✅ Infrastructure Ready
- `.env.codex` file configured with read-only credentials
- `.env.codex.example` template exists
- Branch restrictions defined (staging/codex-*)
- Credential boundary tests implemented
- Handoff markers documented ([CODEX-READY], [CLAUDE-APPLIED])
- Complete SOP for dual-lane workflow

#### ❌ No Actual Codex Implementation
- No Codex agent class or service
- No way to invoke or switch to Codex mode
- No actual Codex commits in git history
- All work done by Claude/EXEC agent
- Retrospective explicitly notes Codex was "simulated"

### 3. Evidence from Implementation

#### From Git History
```bash
# No actual [CODEX-READY] commits found
# No staging/codex-* branches created
# All implementation done on feature/* branches by Claude
```

#### From Retrospective (dual-lane-R1-retro.md)
- Line 21: "staging/codex-agents-bridge branch created **(simulated)**"
- Line 44: "tests/negative/simulate-negative-tests.sh - 4/4 passed"
- Line 65: "Time: [CODEX-READY] → PR Open | ~15 minutes" (theoretical)
- Line 70: "SLSA L3 Provenance Coverage | 0% (not signed)"

#### From Test Results
- Credential boundary test: Validates the separation but doesn't invoke Codex
- End-to-end test: All work performed by Claude/EXEC
- No actual handoff from Codex to Claude occurred

## 4. Why This Matters

### Current State: Theoretical Dual-Lane
```
Documentation: LEAD → Codex → Claude → Production
Reality:       LEAD → Claude → Production
```

### The Missing Component
Codex appears to be:
1. Another AI system (like Claude) that would need to be invoked
2. Not available in the current environment
3. Replaced by Claude doing both builder and enforcer roles

## 5. Recommendations

### Option 1: Accept Single-Lane Reality
- Acknowledge that Claude performs both roles
- Update documentation to reflect actual workflow
- Remove Codex references or mark as "future capability"

### Option 2: Implement Codex Functionality
- Create actual Codex mode for Claude with read-only restrictions
- Implement branch switching logic
- Enforce credential boundaries programmatically
- Create real handoff mechanisms

### Option 3: True Dual-Agent Setup
- Integrate actual second AI agent as Codex
- Implement agent switching/invocation
- Create real credential isolation
- Enable true dual-lane workflow

## Conclusion

The extensive documentation and infrastructure for Codex demonstrates **excellent architectural planning** for a dual-lane workflow. However, the absence of actual Codex usage means:

1. **Security boundaries are theoretical** - Claude has write access throughout
2. **Audit trail is incomplete** - No actual Codex → Claude handoffs
3. **SLSA L3 compliance is partial** - Single agent doing all work

The system is "**Codex-capable**" but not "**Codex-active**". The dual-lane workflow exists only in documentation and test scenarios, not in practice.

## Answer to Your Question

**"Does this prove that we are leveraging Codex?"**

No, it proves we have a well-designed **framework** for leveraging Codex, but we are not actually using Codex. All implementation work was done by Claude acting as EXEC, with no real dual-lane separation in practice.

The infrastructure is like having:
- Two lanes on a highway ✅
- Signs for both lanes ✅
- Rules for each lane ✅
- But only one car using one lane ❌
