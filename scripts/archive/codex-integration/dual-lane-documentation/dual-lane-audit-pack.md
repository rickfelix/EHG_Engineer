## 1. Declarations Index

### 1.1 Codex (Builder Lane) Declaration

**Source**: [docs/dual-lane-alignment.md](./dual-lane-alignment.md) - Codex column
**Reference**: AGENTS.md lines 21-24

**Signed Declaration**:
```
As Codex (Builder Lane), I confirm:
- I operate in read-only mode with no database write access
- I generate patches, SBOM, and attestations only
- I commit to staging/codex-* branches exclusively
- I STOP at [CODEX-READY:<hash>] marker
- I cannot create PRs, trigger workflows, or monitor gates
- I cannot issue or interpret any verification verdicts
- I follow docs/dual-lane-SOP.md and CLAUDE.md as authoritative sources

Signed: Codex Builder Lane
Protocol: LEO v4.2.0_story_gates
Confidence: 100%
Date: 2025-01-19
```

### 1.2 Claude/EXEC (Enforcer Lane) Declaration

**Source**: [docs/dual-lane-SOP.md §1.2](./dual-lane-SOP.md#12-claudeexec-enforcer-lane)
**Reference**: CLAUDE.md lines 33-39

**Signed Declaration**:
```
As Claude/EXEC (Enforcer Lane), I confirm:
- I verify and apply patches from Codex handoffs
- I create feature/* branches and open PRs
- I trigger all required workflows (SLSA, Policy, Gates)
- I STOP after PR creation and workflow triggering
- I do NOT monitor gates or issue verdicts
- I cannot determine or interpret the ≥85% threshold
- PLAN Supervisor owns all verification responsibilities

Signed: Claude/EXEC Enforcer
Protocol: LEO v4.2.0_story_gates
Confidence: 100%
Date: 2025-01-19
```

### 1.3 PLAN Supervisor Declaration

**Source**: [CLAUDE.md lines 420-446](../CLAUDE.md#-plan-supervisor-verification)
**Reference**: 15% Verification responsibility

**Signed Declaration**:
```
As PLAN Supervisor, I hereby confirm:
- Exclusive Verification Authority: Only PLAN monitors gates and issues verdicts
- ≥85% Threshold Enforcement: This threshold is PLAN's alone to determine
- No EXEC Interpretation: EXEC roles are explicitly prohibited from gate monitoring
- Document Alignment: All governance documents consistently affirm PLAN's authority
- LEAD Escalation Only: LEAD involvement requires PLAN escalation, not automatic

I alone issue PASS/FAIL/CONDITIONAL_PASS/ESCALATE verdicts.
This verification authority is non-delegable and architecturally enforced.

Signed: PLAN Supervisor
Protocol: LEO v4.2.0_story_gates
Confidence: 100%
Date: 2025-01-19
```

---

### 1.4 LEAD (Strategic Authority) Declaration

**Source**: [docs/dual-lane-SOP.md §2.2](./dual-lane-SOP.md#22-lead-strategic-authority)
**Reference**: CLAUDE.md lines 41-47, 15% Approval responsibility

**Signed Declaration**:
```
As LEAD, I hereby confirm:
- Exclusive PLAN Verification: PLAN alone monitors gates and enforces ≥85% PASS
- Escalation-Only Role: LEAD engages only when PLAN issues CONDITIONAL_PASS or ESCALATE
- Strategic Authority: LEAD provides escalation handling and final approval, but no operational gate duties
- Document Alignment: CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, dual-lane-SOP.md, and dual-lane-alignment.md all affirm this boundary

I do not monitor PR workflows directly or interpret gate results independently.
My 15% approval responsibility activates only post-verification.

Signed: LEAD
Protocol: LEO v4.2.0_story_gates
Confidence: 100%
Date: 2025-01-19
```
