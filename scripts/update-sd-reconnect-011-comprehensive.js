    description: `Integrate chairman decision logging, calibration, and analytics infrastructure (164KB, 3840 LOC chairman components + 658 LOC services) to enable AI threshold optimization, decision override tracking, and automated system calibration. Current: Components built (ChairmanDashboard, CalibrationReview, DecisionsInbox, etc.) with calibration.ts service (294 LOC) implementing decision logging and delta proposals, but limited usage (44 references) and no automated calibration workflow.

**CURRENT STATE - DECISION INFRASTRUCTURE EXISTS, LIMITED INTEGRATION**:
- ✅ Chairman components directory: 164KB, 3840 LOC (ChairmanDashboard, ChairmanFeedbackPanel, ChairmanOverridePanel, etc.)
- ✅ Calibration service: calibration.ts 294 LOC - logDecision(), getDeltaProposals(), getDecisionStats()
- ✅ Decision types: Decision, DeltaProposal, DecisionStats interfaces with system_decision, human_decision, override tracking
- ✅ useChairmanData hook: 364 LOC - fetches decisions, stats, proposals
- ⚠️ Limited usage: 44 references to calibration/decision features across codebase
- ❌ No automated calibration workflow - manual threshold adjustments only
- ❌ Decision logging not universal - only 44 integration points, should be 100+ (all AI decisions)
- ❌ No decision analytics dashboard - data collected but not visualized
- ❌ No ML-powered threshold recommendations - delta proposals exist but not auto-generated

**CHAIRMAN DECISION INFRASTRUCTURE (164KB, 3840 LOC components + 658 LOC services)**:

**Components (8 chairman components, 3840 LOC)**:
- ChairmanDashboard.tsx: Main executive dashboard, metrics overview
- ChairmanFeedbackPanel.tsx: Feedback capture, decision rationale
- ChairmanOverridePanel.tsx: Override AI decisions, provide rationale
- CalibrationReview.tsx: Review calibration proposals
- ChairmanFeedbackDisplay.tsx: Display feedback history
- DecisionsInbox.tsx: Pending decisions queue
- ExecutiveDecisionSupport.tsx: AI-powered decision support
- ChairmanOverrideControls.tsx: Override controls in validation flows

**Services (calibration.ts 294 LOC, useChairmanData.ts 364 LOC)**:
- logDecision(): Log human vs system decision with override flag, rationale tags
- getDeltaProposals(): Fetch AI-generated threshold adjustment proposals
- getDecisionStats(): Calculate override rate, agreement rate, confidence
- Decision schema: venture_id, stage_id, inputs (metric, threshold), system_decision (action, confidence, reasoning), human_decision (action, override, rationale)

**Decision Logging Pattern**:
- System makes decision: action='approve', confidence=0.85, reasoning='Revenue >$10K threshold'
- Human overrides: action='reject', override=true, rationale_tags=['market_timing', 'team_concerns']
- System learns: If override_rate >20% for threshold, generate DeltaProposal to adjust threshold
- Example: 'Revenue threshold too low, 25% override rate, propose $15K → $20K'

**GAPS IDENTIFIED**:
1. **Sparse Decision Logging (44 references, need 100+)**:
   - Only 44 code locations call logDecision()
   - Should log EVERY AI decision: Stage transitions, EVA validations, risk assessments, profitability forecasts
   - Missing: Stage1-40 AI decisions, workflow auto-progression, quality gates
   - Impact: Insufficient data for calibration, ML models undertrained

2. **No Automated Calibration Workflow**:
   - getDeltaProposals() fetches proposals, but who generates them? Manual?
   - Need: Background job analyzing decisions → detecting patterns → auto-generating proposals
   - Example: Every Sunday, analyze week's decisions, find thresholds with >20% override, create proposals
   - Current: Proposals exist in DB, but no automation to create them

3. **Decision Analytics Dashboard Missing**:
   - ChairmanDashboard exists, but no decision analytics view
   - Need: Override rate trends, most-overridden thresholds, calibration impact charts
   - Data: DecisionStats interface has total, overrides, agreements, override_rate - ready to visualize
   - Current: Data collected, not displayed

4. **No ML-Powered Recommendations**:
   - DeltaProposal has confidence, reasoning fields - suggests ML intent
   - Need: ML model analyzing decision patterns, recommending threshold adjustments
   - Example: 'Based on 50 decisions, revenue threshold 92% accurate at $18K (current $15K), suggest increase'
   - Current: Proposals manually created or not at all

5. **No Feedback Loop to AI Models**:
   - Decisions logged, but do AI models learn from overrides?
   - Need: Retrain EVA validation, risk scoring, profitability models with chairman feedback
   - Example: If chairman always overrides 'team concerns' flag, reduce weight in model
   - Current: One-way logging, no model updates`,

    scope: `**8-Week Chairman Decision Analytics & Calibration Integration**:

**PHASE 1: Decision Logging Expansion (Weeks 1-2)**
- Audit all AI decision points: Stages 1-40, EVA validation, risk scoring, profitability
- Instrument with logDecision() calls: Target 100+ integration points (up from 44)
- Standardize decision schema across all AI features

**PHASE 2: Automated Calibration Workflow (Weeks 3-4)**
- Background job: Analyze decisions weekly, detect override patterns
- Auto-generate DeltaProposals for thresholds with >20% override rate
- Chairman review UI: Approve/reject/modify proposals in CalibrationReview.tsx

**PHASE 3: Decision Analytics Dashboard (Weeks 5-6)**
- Build ChairmanAnalyticsDashboard: Override trends, threshold accuracy, calibration impact
- Charts: Override rate over time, most-overridden thresholds, decision confidence distribution
- Integrate into ChairmanDashboard as new tab

**PHASE 4: ML-Powered Recommendations (Weeks 7-8)**
- ML model: Train on decision history, predict optimal thresholds
- Auto-generate proposals with confidence scores
- A/B test: Compare manual vs ML-generated proposals, measure acceptance rate

**OUT OF SCOPE**:
- ❌ Complete AI retraining pipeline (separate initiative)
- ❌ Multi-chairman collaboration (single decision maker for now)
- ❌ Decision versioning/history beyond basic logging`,

    strategic_objectives: [
      "Expand decision logging from 44 to 100+ integration points, capturing EVERY AI decision across Stages 1-40, EVA validation, risk scoring, profitability forecasts",
      "Implement automated calibration workflow: Weekly background job analyzes decisions, detects override patterns (>20% rate), auto-generates DeltaProposals for chairman review",
      "Build decision analytics dashboard visualizing override trends, threshold accuracy, calibration impact, enabling data-driven threshold adjustments",
      "Develop ML-powered threshold recommendations analyzing 50+ decisions per threshold, predicting optimal values with 80%+ confidence",
      "Establish feedback loop from chairman decisions to AI models, improving EVA validation accuracy from 75% → 90% via supervised learning from overrides",
      "Achieve 80% chairman approval rate on auto-generated calibration proposals (vs 50% manual baseline), demonstrating ML recommendation quality"
    ],

    success_criteria: [
      "✅ Decision logging coverage: 100+ logDecision() calls across codebase (up from 44), covering 100% of AI decision points",
      "✅ Automated calibration: Background job runs weekly, generates ≥5 DeltaProposals per run, chairman reviews within 48 hours",
      "✅ Analytics dashboard: ChairmanAnalyticsDashboard live, showing 6+ charts (override trends, threshold accuracy, confidence distribution, calibration impact)",
      "✅ ML recommendations: Model trained on ≥500 decisions, generates proposals with ≥80% confidence, 80% chairman approval rate",
      "✅ AI model improvement: EVA validation accuracy 75% → 90%, risk scoring accuracy 70% → 85%, profitability forecast MAPE <15%",
      "✅ Calibration cycle time: Detect override pattern → generate proposal → chairman review → apply → 7 days (down from manual months)",
      "✅ Override rate reduction: System-wide override rate 30% → 15% within 3 months post-calibration (evidence of learning)",
      "✅ Data quality: 0 missing decision logs, 100% have rationale tags, schema compliance 100%",
      "✅ User adoption: Chairman uses analytics dashboard weekly, reviews calibration proposals 90% within SLA",
      "✅ Performance: Decision logging <50ms overhead, analytics dashboard loads <2s, ML predictions <500ms"
    ],

    key_principles: [
      "**Log Everything**: Every AI decision logged - if system makes choice, chairman can override, must be tracked for learning",
      "**Automated Calibration First**: Don't wait for manual threshold adjustments - detect patterns weekly, propose changes automatically",
      "**Data-Driven Thresholds**: Threshold values based on decision data, not assumptions - 20% override rate = threshold wrong, adjust",
      "**ML Recommendations, Human Approval**: AI suggests, chairman decides - never auto-apply threshold changes without review",
      "**Feedback Loop Mandatory**: Logged decisions MUST feed back to AI models - one-way logging is wasted data",
      "**Fast Calibration Cycles**: 7-day detect-propose-review-apply cycle - slow feedback = slow improvement",
      "**Transparency in AI Decisions**: system_decision includes reasoning - chairman sees why AI chose action, can evaluate logic",
      "**Rationale Tags Required**: human_decision must have rationale_tags - 'just override' insufficient, need categorized feedback"
