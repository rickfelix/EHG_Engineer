  // Critical Lessons Learned
  lessons_learned: {
    lesson_1_manual_vs_tool: {
      title: 'Manual Assessment ‚â† Sub-Agent Execution',
      what_we_learned: 'Manually creating sub-agent results based on code review is NOT the same as running the actual sub-agent tool',
      evidence: 'Manual: 75% confidence. Tool: 60% confidence (-15% delta)',
      why_it_matters: 'Tools perform actual test execution, search for related tests, analyze coverage - things code review cannot do',
      impact: 'HIGH - Manual assessments may overestimate quality',
      pattern: 'ANTI-PATTERN: Simulating sub-agent results instead of executing tools'
    },

    lesson_2_test_discovery: {
      title: 'Test Infrastructure ‚â† Test Coverage for Implementation',
      what_we_learned: 'EHG has 52 test files total, but ZERO tests for SD-RECONNECT-014 implementation (1,712 LOC)',
      evidence: 'QA found 6 related test files, but none test the new RBAC/dashboard components',
      why_it_matters: 'Existing test infrastructure creates false sense of coverage',
      impact: 'CRITICAL - 1,712 LOC completely untested',
      pattern: 'Test infrastructure exists globally, but implementation-specific tests are missing'
    },

    lesson_3_smoke_test_deferral: {
      title: 'Runtime Test Deferral Strategy Worked, But Incomplete',
      what_we_learned: 'Deferring runtime tests (API, UI, auto-refresh) to LEAD phase was pragmatic but they were NEVER executed',
      evidence: '3/6 smoke tests passed (database, files, git). 3/6 deferred but not completed.',
      why_it_matters: 'Deferred ‚â† Done. Must track and execute deferred tests before final approval.',
      impact: 'MEDIUM - Unknown if API/UI/auto-refresh actually work',
      pattern: 'Deferral without execution creates untested functionality in production'
    },

    lesson_4_qa_trigger_timing: {
      title: 'QA Sub-Agent Should Be Triggered Earlier',
      what_we_learned: 'QA was triggered during PLAN verification, but test creation should happen during EXEC',
      evidence: 'EXEC created 1,712 LOC with zero tests. QA discovered this gap too late.',
      why_it_matters: 'Tests should be written alongside implementation (TDD/BDD)',
      impact: 'HIGH - Retrofitting tests is harder than writing them during development',
      pattern: 'QA as afterthought instead of integrated into EXEC workflow'
    },

    lesson_5_tool_execution_mandate: {
      title: 'Sub-Agent Tools MUST Be Actually Executed',
      what_we_learned: 'LEO Protocol specifies sub-agents, but doesn\'t enforce actual tool execution',
      evidence: 'Manual simulation passed protocol checks. Only user intervention revealed the gap.',
      why_it_matters: 'Protocol compliance ‚â† Process quality without enforcement',
      impact: 'CRITICAL - Protocol can be "gamed" without real quality validation',
      pattern: 'Need execution verification, not just metadata simulation'
    }
  },

  // Process Improvements
  process_improvements: {
    improvement_1_mandatory_tool_execution: {
      title: 'Mandate Actual Sub-Agent Tool Execution',
      problem: 'Sub-agents can be "simulated" without running tools',
      solution: 'Add execution verification: sub-agent results must include tool_executed: true with timestamp and output hash',
      implementation: 'Update LEO Protocol validation rules to reject simulated results',
      benefit: 'Guarantees real analysis, not code review guesses',
      priority: 'CRITICAL'
    },

    improvement_2_exec_phase_test_creation: {
      title: 'Integrate Test Creation into EXEC Phase',
      problem: 'EXEC creates implementation without tests, QA discovers gap later',
      solution: 'EXEC checklist: "Create unit tests for all new components (min 50% coverage)"',
      implementation: 'Add test creation as EXEC deliverable, block EXEC‚ÜíPLAN handoff without tests',
      benefit: 'Tests created alongside implementation, easier to write, higher coverage',
      priority: 'HIGH'
    },

    improvement_3_deferred_test_tracking: {
      title: 'Track Deferred Tests Until Execution',
      problem: 'Deferred smoke tests were never executed before approval',
      solution: 'Create "deferred_tests" tracking table with status: DEFERRED ‚Üí SCHEDULED ‚Üí EXECUTED',
      implementation: 'LEAD approval blocked until all deferred tests marked EXECUTED',
      benefit: 'Ensures deferred tests are completed, not forgotten',
      priority: 'HIGH'
    },

    improvement_4_test_first_protocol: {
      title: 'Optional Test-First Mode for High-Risk SDs',
      problem: 'Critical implementations (security, data) should have tests before approval',
      solution: 'LEAD can flag SD as "test_first_required: true" during approval',
      implementation: 'If flagged, EXEC‚ÜíPLAN blocked until test coverage ‚â• 50%',
      benefit: 'Quality gate for critical functionality',
      priority: 'MEDIUM'
    },

    improvement_5_qa_parallel_execution: {
      title: 'Run QA Sub-Agent in Parallel with Other Sub-Agents',
      problem: 'QA was one of 4 sub-agents in PLAN phase, but could start earlier',
      solution: 'Trigger QA during EXEC‚ÜíPLAN handoff creation (before other sub-agents)',
      implementation: 'QA runs while PLAN prepares verification, results ready when PLAN starts',
      benefit: 'Faster feedback loop, no time added to critical path',
      priority: 'LOW'
