    description: `Create comprehensive feature catalog and discovery system for 40+ platform capabilities, preventing 'hidden features' problem where capabilities exist but users cannot find/understand them. Build feature directory at /features, documentation database, search/filter system, and contextual help integration. Current: No feature catalog, no centralized documentation, users discover features by accident or never at all, causing underutilization of platform capabilities and high support burden.

**CURRENT STATE - DISCOVERY PROBLEM**:
- ‚ùå No feature catalog: Users don't know what platform can do (40+ features exist but undocumented)
- ‚ùå No feature directory page: No /features route showing capabilities
- ‚ùå No search: Cannot search "how to export reports" or "voice commands"
- ‚ùå Scattered documentation: Some features have README files, most have none
- ‚ùå No categorization: Features not grouped (Analytics, Automation, AI, Internationalization, etc.)
- ‚ùå No contextual help: ? icons missing, no tooltips explaining features
- ‚ùå No "What's New": Users miss new features when shipped
- ‚ùå High support burden: Same questions repeatedly ("How do I...?", "Can it...?")

**RECONNECTION IMPACT - 15 MAJOR FEATURES EXPOSED**:
From reconnection work, we've exposed:
1. Predictive Analytics (ML forecasting, 6 algorithms)
2. Export Engine (PDF/Excel/CSV/JSON)
3. Automation Control (40 rules, self-learning)
4. Voice Internationalization (17 languages, voice commands)
5. FirstRunWizard (onboarding)
6. Analytics Export (report generation)
7. Chairman Decision Analytics (calibration)
8. Navigation Enhancements (Cmd+K, global search)
9. Realtime Sync (Supabase realtime)
10. Venture Creation Workflow (40 stages)
11. Component Library (58 Shadcn components)
12. Stage Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)
13. Pattern Detection (automation learning)
14. Cultural Formatting (dates/numbers/currency)
15. RTL Support (Arabic, Hebrew)

**DOCUMENTATION NEEDS**:
- **What**: Feature name, description, use cases
- **Why**: Business value, ROI, when to use
- **How**: Step-by-step guides, screenshots, videos
- **Where**: Routes, navigation paths, keyboard shortcuts
- **Troubleshooting**: Common issues, solutions, FAQs`,

    scope: `**6-Week Feature Documentation & Discovery System**:

**PHASE 1: Feature Inventory & Categorization (Week 1)**
- Audit all platform features (target 40+)
- Create feature taxonomy (8 categories)
- Build features database table
- Define feature metadata schema

**PHASE 2: Feature Directory UI (Week 2)**
- Create FeatureDirectory page at /features
- Build feature cards with icons, descriptions
- Add search and filter functionality
- Implement category navigation

**PHASE 3: Documentation System (Weeks 3-4)**
- Write documentation for top 20 features
- Create documentation template
- Build in-app documentation viewer
- Add screenshots and examples

**PHASE 4: Contextual Help (Week 5)**
- Add ? icons throughout UI
- Build HelpTooltip component
- Create feature tooltips
- Add keyboard shortcut hints

**PHASE 5: Discovery Features (Week 6)**
- Build "What's New" section
- Add feature spotlight widget
- Create feature tour system
- Implement usage analytics

**OUT OF SCOPE**:
- ‚ùå Video tutorials (written guides sufficient initially)
- ‚ùå AI-powered help assistant (rule-based sufficient)
- ‚ùå Community forums (later phase)`,

    strategic_objectives: [
      "Create comprehensive feature inventory: Audit and document all 40+ platform capabilities with name, description, category, route, screenshot, use cases",
      "Build FeatureDirectory page at /features: Searchable, filterable catalog with 8 categories (Analytics, Automation, AI, Workflows, Internationalization, Reports, Settings, Integrations)",
      "Implement feature search: Global search bar finds features by name, description, keywords (e.g., 'export reports' ‚Üí Export Engine, Analytics Export)",
      "Write documentation for top 20 features: Step-by-step guides with screenshots, use cases, troubleshooting, keyboard shortcuts",
      "Add contextual help system: ? icons throughout UI, HelpTooltip component, feature-specific tooltips, 'Learn More' links to documentation",
      "Build 'What's New' section: Highlight recently added features, version history, changelog, keep users informed of new capabilities",
      "Achieve 80%+ feature awareness: Target 80% of users know ‚â•10 major features exist (up from current ~30%), measured via survey/analytics",
      "Reduce support burden 50%: Target 50% reduction in 'How do I...?' support tickets through self-service documentation"
    ],

    success_criteria: [
      "‚úÖ Feature catalog complete: ‚â•40 features documented with name, description, category, route, icon, use cases",
      "‚úÖ FeatureDirectory live: /features route accessible, shows all features, search works, filters by category, responsive design",
      "‚úÖ Search functional: Global search finds features by name/description/keywords, <200ms response, ‚â•95% accuracy",
      "‚úÖ Documentation coverage: Top 20 features have complete guides (what/why/how/where/troubleshooting), ‚â•10 with screenshots",
      "‚úÖ Contextual help integrated: ‚â•30 ? icons added across UI, HelpTooltip component in use, tooltips explain features",
      "‚úÖ What's New section: Shows last 10 features added, changelog format, links to documentation, updated with each release",
      "‚úÖ Feature awareness: ‚â•80% of users know ‚â•10 major features exist (survey), ‚â•60% use feature directory, ‚â•40% click contextual help",
      "‚úÖ Support reduction: ‚â•50% reduction in 'How do I...?' tickets, ‚â•70% of questions answered by documentation, ticket deflection tracked",
      "‚úÖ Usage increase: ‚â•30% increase in feature usage after documentation (measure before/after for Predictive Analytics, Export, Automation)",

    ],

    key_principles: [
      "**Documentation is UI**: Undocumented features don't exist to users - docs are as important as code",
      "**Discoverability First**: Users shouldn't need to ask 'Can it...?' - feature directory answers proactively",
      "**Show, Don't Tell**: Screenshots > long text, videos > screenshots, interactive demos > videos",
      "**Contextual Over Central**: Help where users need it (? icons) > separate help center they must navigate to",
      "**Search is Critical**: Users search ('export reports', 'voice commands'), not browse categories - optimize for search",
      "**Maintenance Mandatory**: Outdated docs worse than no docs - false information damages trust, update docs with features",
      "**Progressive Disclosure**: Simple explanation upfront, 'Learn More' for details, don't overwhelm with complexity",
      "**Measure Impact**: Track feature usage before/after documentation, prove documentation drives adoption"
