    description: `Systematic audit and cleanup of placeholder features to eliminate technical debt, reduce user confusion, and focus development resources. Currently 88KB of stub code (20KB knowledge management + 68KB creative media) and 19 "coming soon" messages create false expectations and maintenance burden.

**CURRENT STATE - PLACEHOLDER FEATURE CRISIS**:
- ‚ùå 88KB of stub components with ZERO backend implementation
- ‚ùå 19 "coming soon" messages across 10+ components
- ‚ùå 43 TODO/FIXME/STUB markers indicating incomplete work
- ‚ùå 0 imports for major stub features (KnowledgeManagementDashboard, Creative Media suite)

**CRITICAL PLACEHOLDERS (88KB code, 2090 LOC)**:

  **1. Knowledge Management Dashboard (20KB, 486 LOC)**:
  - Location: src/components/knowledge-management/KnowledgeManagementDashboard.tsx
  - Evidence: Full component with hooks, but hooks return mock data, 0 imports found
  - Status: ORPHANED - Built UI, no backend, not in navigation
  - Decision Options: REMOVE (no backend) | DEFER (define scope) | BUILD (40-60h)

  **2. Creative Media Automation Suite (68KB, 1604 LOC)**:
  - ContentGenerationEngine.tsx (509 LOC): AI content generation, API calls to non-existent endpoints
  - VideoProductionPipeline.tsx (504 LOC): Video workflow automation, stub implementation
  - CreativeOptimization.tsx (591 LOC): Creative asset optimization, no backend
  - Evidence: Components make API calls that fail, 0 imports found
  - Status: ORPHANED - Advanced features, no backend infrastructure
  - Decision Options: REMOVE (low priority) | DEFER (ML initiative) | BUILD (80-120h)

**"COMING SOON" PLACEHOLDERS (19 instances)**:
- EVA KnowledgeBase: "Advanced contextual search coming soon", "AI insights engine coming soon"
- Orchestration: "Queue configuration coming soon", "Worker management coming soon", "Performance monitoring coming soon"
- Agents page: "EVA, LEAD, PLAN, EXEC agents coming soon"
- Portfolios: "Multi-company portfolio management coming soon", "Risk analysis dashboard coming soon"
- VentureDetail: "Financial modeling coming soon", "Team assignments coming soon", "Stage deliverables coming soon"
- VentureDetailEnhanced: 4√ó "coming soon" tabs (Financial, Team, Documents, Timeline)

**TECHNICAL DEBT MARKERS (43 instances)**:
- TODO comments indicating incomplete work
- FIXME comments highlighting broken functionality
- STUB markers for placeholder implementations
- WIP (Work In Progress) markers for abandoned features

**ROOT CAUSES**:
1. **Speculative development**: Features built before requirements validated
2. **Backend-first planning**: UI created before backend infrastructure ready
3. **Abandoned initiatives**: Features started but not completed due to priority shifts
4. **Lack of governance**: No policy requiring backend before UI
5. **User expectation mismanagement**: "Coming soon" creates false hope

**TARGET OUTCOME**:
- 70-80KB code reduction (remove orphaned stubs)
- 0 "coming soon" messages (replace with clear roadmap or remove)
- <10 TODO/FIXME markers (resolve or document)
- Clear product roadmap with defined timelines for deferred features
- User communication plan for removed features
- Governance policy preventing future placeholder accumulation`,

    scope: `**6-Week Phased Cleanup Strategy**:

**PHASE 1: Comprehensive Audit (Week 1)**
1. Scan codebase for all "coming soon" messages
2. Identify all stub components (0 imports, mock data)
3. Catalog TODO/FIXME/STUB markers
4. Calculate total code size of placeholders
5. Create decision matrix for each placeholder

**PHASE 2: Decision Framework Application (Week 2)**
6. Apply BUILD/DEFER/REMOVE framework to each feature
7. For BUILD: Estimate effort, create SD, add to backlog
8. For DEFER: Define scope, set timeline, document in roadmap
9. For REMOVE: Document rationale, plan communication
10. Get stakeholder approval for removals

**PHASE 3: Knowledge Management Cleanup (Week 3)**
11. DECISION: DEFER Knowledge Management (scope unclear, low priority)
12. Remove KnowledgeManagementDashboard component (486 LOC)
13. Remove unused hooks (useKnowledgeDashboard, useKnowledgeSearch)
14. Update imports and remove dead code paths
15. Document in roadmap: "Knowledge Base - Q3 2025"

**PHASE 4: Creative Media Suite Cleanup (Week 4)**
16. DECISION: REMOVE Creative Media Suite (advanced, no demand)
17. Delete creative-media/ directory (68KB, 3 components)
18. Remove Stage34CreativeMediaAutomation component
19. Update any references or imports
20. Communicate removal to users if exposed

**PHASE 5: "Coming Soon" Message Cleanup (Week 5)**
21. Replace 19 "coming soon" messages with roadmap links
22. Update EVA KnowledgeBase placeholders (contextual search, AI insights)
23. Update Orchestration placeholders (queue config, worker mgmt, performance)
24. Update Agents page placeholder (agent list)
25. Update Portfolios placeholders (multi-company, risk analysis)
26. Update VentureDetail placeholders (financial, team, deliverables)
27. Update VentureDetailEnhanced tabs (Financial, Team, Docs, Timeline)
28. Add "View Roadmap" links instead of "coming soon"

**PHASE 6: Technical Debt Resolution (Week 6)**
29. Review 43 TODO/FIXME/STUB markers
30. Resolve or remove TODOs (fix implementation or delete feature)
31. Document remaining TODOs with tracking issues
32. Create governance policy (no UI without backend)
33. Add pre-commit hook to flag new "coming soon" messages
34. Update product roadmap with deferred features
35. Communicate changes to users (blog post, email)`,
