    description: `Systematic audit and integration of database tables to maximize business value from data infrastructure. Currently 137 tables actively accessed in code, but 16 business-critical tables (57% of schema) lack UI coverage, representing significant hidden value.

**CURRENT STATE - DATABASE-UI GAP ANALYSIS**:
- ✅ 137 tables actively accessed in frontend code (supabase.from() calls)
- ✅ 28 tables defined in schema files (foundation layer)
- ❌ 16 tables with ZERO UI coverage despite business-critical data:

  **CRITICAL PRIORITY (8 tables)**:
  - chairman_dashboard_config (personalization, widgets, KPI selection)
  - executive_reports (automated board reports, templates, scheduling)
  - performance_cycle (4-phase tracking: strategy → goals → planning → implementation)
  - synergy_opportunities + synergy_opportunity_ventures (cross-company value identification)
  - exit_workflows + exit_workflow_steps + team_transitions (exit strategy execution)
  - strategic_decisions (AI-assisted decision tracking with rationale)

  **HIGH PRIORITY (5 tables)**:
  - automation_learning_queue (ML training data for automation improvement)
  - automation_patterns (detected patterns for automation optimization)
  - calibration_sessions (venture assessment calibration data)

  **INTERNAL-ONLY (3 tables)**:
  - *_demo_backup tables (backup/restore infrastructure - no UI needed)
  - demo_data_audit (internal tracking - admin-only access)

**BUSINESS VALUE AT RISK**:
- Chairman Dashboard: No personalization UI (chairman_dashboard_config unused)
- Executive Reporting: No report builder (executive_reports unused)
- Performance Cycles: No 4-phase tracking UI (performance_cycle unused)
- Synergy Management: No opportunity tracking (synergy_opportunities unused)
- Exit Strategy: No workflow execution UI (exit_workflows unused)
- Strategic Decisions: No decision log/tracking (strategic_decisions unused)

**ROOT CAUSES**:
1. **Schema-first development**: Tables created before UI requirements finalized
2. **Incomplete feature rollout**: Backend ready, frontend never built
3. **Priority shifts**: Other features took precedence, orphaning tables
4. **Lack of visibility**: No systematic tracking of table-to-UI mapping
5. **Missing documentation**: Table purposes and usage not documented

**TARGET OUTCOME**:
- Complete table catalog with categorization (critical/high/internal/deprecated)
- UI coverage for 10+ high-value tables (chairman config, reports, performance, synergy, exit)
- Table-to-UI mapping documentation
- Automated monitoring for new tables without UI
- Business value unlocked: $200K-$400K in hidden features made accessible`,
