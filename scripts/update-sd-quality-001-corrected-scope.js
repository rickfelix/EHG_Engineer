    title: 'Unit Test Coverage Gap - Business Logic Testing',

    description: `EHG application has extensive E2E (Playwright), integration, accessibility, security, and performance test coverage (63 total test files), but only 4 unit test files covering 528 source files in src/ directory.

**ACTUAL STATE (Discovered via Investigation)**:
- ‚úÖ 63 test files in /mnt/c/_EHG/ehg/tests/
- ‚úÖ Extensive E2E test suite (Playwright)
- ‚úÖ Integration tests configured
- ‚úÖ Accessibility tests (a11y)
- ‚úÖ Security and performance tests
- ‚ùå Only 4 unit test files in tests/unit/
- ‚ùå 528 source files in src/ with minimal unit test coverage
- ‚ùå Estimated unit test coverage: ~5-10%

**ORIGINAL MISREPRESENTATION**:
- Claimed: "362,538 LOC with 6 test files (0.001% coverage)"
- Reality: 63 test files with extensive E2E/integration coverage
- Actual gap: Unit test coverage for business logic

**ROOT CAUSE**:
- Tests for EHG stored in /mnt/c/_EHG/ehg/tests/
- Tests for EHG_Engineer stored in /mnt/c/_EHG/EHG_Engineer/tests/
- Multi-application architecture was not documented
- Original SD author looked in wrong location or only counted unit tests

**TARGET OUTCOME**:
- Achieve 50% unit test coverage for critical business logic
- Focus on src/services/, src/utils/, src/hooks/
- Add 40-60 unit test files targeting high-value code paths
- Maintain existing E2E/integration test coverage`,

    scope: `1. **Unit Test Infrastructure Verification** (Week 1)
   - Verify Vitest configuration (vitest.config.ts)
   - Confirm coverage reporting (v8 provider)
   - Create test utilities and fixtures
   - Set up test data factories

2. **Core Business Logic Testing** (Weeks 2-3)
   - Test critical services in src/services/
   - Test utility functions in src/utils/
   - Test custom hooks in src/hooks/
   - Focus on high-value, frequently used code

3. **Component Logic Testing** (Week 4)
   - Test complex component logic in src/components/
   - Test state management patterns
   - Test API integration logic
   - Test data transformation utilities

4. **CI/CD Integration** (Week 5)
   - Add unit test execution to GitHub Actions
   - Configure coverage threshold enforcement (50%)
   - Set up PR test gates
   - Add coverage reporting to PRs

5. **Documentation** (Week 6)
   - Document unit testing patterns
   - Create test examples for common scenarios
   - Update team testing guidelines
   - Document test location architecture`,
