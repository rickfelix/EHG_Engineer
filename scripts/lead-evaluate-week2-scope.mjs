const evaluation = {
  requirement: 'REQ-002: Executive Reporting System',
  original_acceptance_criteria: [
    'Report builder accessible at /reports/builder',
    'Create report templates with sections (metrics, charts, narrative)',
    'Schedule reports (weekly/monthly/quarterly)',
    'Manage recipient list (email distribution)',
    'Generate PDF reports on-demand',
    'View report history and analytics'
  ],

  // Question 1: What problem does this solve?
  q1_problem: {
    question: 'What specific business problem does this solve?',
    answer: 'Executives spend 10+ hours/month manually creating board reports. Need automated templates and scheduling.',
    value: 'Save 10+ hours/month per executive = $5K-$15K/month in time savings'
  },

  // Question 2: 80/20 solution?
  q2_simplest: {
    question: 'What is the simplest solution that delivers 80% of the value?',

        'Recipient management (can use email client)',
        'Analytics on reports (nice-to-have, not critical)'
      ]
    },
    recommendation: 'Focus on: Report builder, PDF export, history view. Defer: Scheduling, recipient management, analytics.'
  },

  // Question 3: Can we use existing tools?
  q3_existing: {
    question: 'Can we use off-the-shelf tools instead?',
    options: [
      { tool: 'Google Slides/PowerPoint', reason: 'Manual, no automation - defeats purpose' },

      { tool: 'Custom React components', reason: 'Fits existing stack, reusable' }
    ],

  },

  // Question 4: What can we defer?
  q4_defer: {
    question: 'What features can be deferred to later iterations?',
    defer_to_later: [
      'Report scheduling (Week 3 or separate SD)',
      'Email recipient management (use manual email for now)',
      'Report analytics (views, opens, etc.)',
      'Advanced chart customization (start with basic charts)'
    ],
    keep_for_week2: [
      'Report builder UI',
      'Template creation (3-5 pre-built templates)',
      'PDF export',

  // Question 5: What is MVP?
  q5_mvp: {
    question: 'What is the absolute minimum viable product?',
    mvp: [
      'Create report with title, sections, and basic metrics',
      'Use 2-3 pre-built templates',
      'Export as PDF',
      'Save to database (executive_reports table)',
      'View list of past reports'
    ],
    estimated_effort: '15-20 hours (vs 40-50 original)'
  },

  // Question 6: Are we over-engineering?
  q6_over_engineering: {
    question: 'Are there signs of over-engineering?',
    red_flags: [
      'Scheduling system adds 10-15 hours but delivers <20% value',
      'Recipient management replicates email functionality',
      'Analytics is premature - no user demand yet'
    ],
    green_lights: [
      'Report builder solves real pain point',
      'PDF export is table stakes for board meetings',
