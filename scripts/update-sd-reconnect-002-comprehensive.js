    description: `Unify 3 duplicate venture creation dialogs, integrate Stage1DraftIdea component with venture creation flow, implement workflow orchestration to transition new ventures through 40-stage lifecycle. Current state: 3 separate creation dialogs (598 LOC total), scaffoldStage1() is no-op stub, 63 stage components disconnected from creation, workflow integration references (322 instances) but broken connections.

**CURRENT STATE - FRAGMENTED VENTURE CREATION**:
- ‚ùå 3 duplicate creation dialogs exist simultaneously (CreateVentureDialog.tsx 190 LOC, VentureCreateDialog.tsx 47 LOC, VentureCreationDialog.tsx 361 LOC)
- ‚ùå scaffoldStage1() is empty stub: "Writes docs or DB scaffold later; no-op for now" (src/services/ventures.ts)
- ‚ùå Stage1DraftIdea.tsx (21 form inputs, voice capture, EVA validation) NOT called during venture creation
- ‚ùå No workflow orchestration: ventures created ‚Üí stay at Stage 0 ‚Üí never progress through 40 stages
- ‚ùå 322 workflow-stage references in code, but connections broken (ventures don't flow to stages automatically)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è VentureCreationDialog has EVA validation (calculateEVAQualityScore), but other 2 dialogs don't
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Voice capture exists (VoiceCapture component) but only in VentureCreationDialog, not others

**VENTURE CREATION DIALOG DUPLICATION (3 components, 598 LOC)**:

  **1. VentureCreationDialog.tsx (361 LOC, Most Complete)**:
  - Features: Title, description, category, assumptions, success criteria, voice capture, EVA validation
  - EVA Integration: calculateEVAQualityScore runs on form change (lines 69-84), quality feedback shown
  - Voice Capture: VoiceCapture component for chairman input
  - Validation: Comprehensive (3-120 char title, 20-2000 char description, required category)
  - Service Calls: createVenture() + scaffoldStage1() (but scaffoldStage1 is no-op)
  - Evidence: Lines 26, 82 - most feature-rich, should be canonical version
  - Gap: Doesn't navigate to Stage1 after creation, doesn't trigger workflow

  **2. CreateVentureDialog.tsx (190 LOC, Simplified)**:
  - Features: Basic form (title, description, category), no voice, no EVA validation
  - Validation: Basic required field checks
  - Service Calls: createVenture() only (no scaffoldStage1 call)
  - Evidence: Simpler version, likely older or alternative flow
  - Gap: Missing EVA quality scoring, no voice capture, creates "dumb" venture without Stage 1 data

  **3. VentureCreateDialog.tsx (47 LOC, Minimal Stub)**:
  - Features: Minimal placeholder, likely not used
  - Evidence: Very small, possibly unused or WIP
  - Recommendation: DELETE - consolidate to VentureCreationDialog

**STAGE1 COMPONENT DISCONNECT (Stage1DraftIdea.tsx, 21 form inputs)**:
- Purpose: Comprehensive idea capture (title, description, category, tags, company, voice, strategic context)
- Features: Voice recording (Mic icon), transcription, chairman feedback, strategic alignment (75%), performance phase
- Reality: Standalone component, NOT integrated with venture creation flow
- Problem: Users create venture via dialog (basic 3 fields) ‚Üí venture created ‚Üí Stage1DraftIdea never shown
- Expected: Create venture via basic dialog ‚Üí redirect to Stage1DraftIdea ‚Üí full idea capture ‚Üí save to venture
- Evidence: VentureCreationDialog calls scaffoldStage1() but it's no-op, Stage1 data never captured
- Impact: Ventures missing rich Stage 1 metadata (tags, strategic context, voice, chairman feedback)

**WORKFLOW ORCHESTRATION GAP (40 stages, 63 components)**:
- Current: Venture created ‚Üí sits at stage 0 or unknown stage ‚Üí no automatic progression
- Components Exist:
  - CompleteWorkflowOrchestrator.tsx (916 LOC) - main orchestrator, not called
  - DynamicStageRenderer.tsx (14KB, 408 LOC) - renders stages dynamically, disconnected
  - WorkflowStageMap.tsx (8.9KB, 258 LOC) - visual workflow map, standalone
  - StageConfigurationForm.tsx (22KB, 665 LOC) - stage config, not integrated
  - WorkflowProgress.tsx (13KB, 382 LOC) - progress tracking, isolated
- Problem: All workflow components exist, but venture creation doesn't trigger workflow start
- Expected Flow:
  1. User creates venture (VentureCreationDialog)
  2. Venture saved to database with stage = 1
  3. Redirect to Stage1DraftIdea component
  4. User completes Stage 1 form (21 inputs + voice)
  5. Stage1 data saved to venture
  6. Workflow orchestrator kicks in ‚Üí Stage 1 ‚Üí Stage 2 ‚Üí ... ‚Üí Stage 40
  7. User guided through each stage automatically
- Current Flow:
  1. User creates venture (basic 3 fields)
  2. Venture saved with stage = 0
  3. User redirected to... nowhere? Venture grid?
  4. Stages 1-40 never triggered
  5. Workflow components unused
- Evidence: 322 "workflow.*stage" references but no createVenture ‚Üí workflow connection

**SCAFFOLDSTAGE1 STUB (No-Op Function)**:
- Current Implementation: No-op function that returns true immediately without creating workflow data
- Called By: VentureCreationDialog.tsx line 26 (after createVenture)
- Purpose: Should scaffold Stage 1 data structure, create workflow entry, initialize stage progression
- Reality: Returns true immediately, does nothing
- Impact: Ventures created without workflow scaffolding, stages never initialized
- Needed Implementation:
  1. Create workflow_executions entry (venture_id, current_stage: 1, status: 'in_progress')
  2. Create stage_data entry for Stage 1 (venture_id, stage_number: 1, data: {})
  3. Set venture.current_stage = 1 in database
  4. Return stage 1 URL for redirect (/ventures/{id}/stage/1)

**NAVIGATION FLOW GAP**:
- After venture creation: Where does user go?
- VentureCreationDialog: onSuccess callback called, but no automatic navigation to Stage1
- Expected: onSuccess ‚Üí navigate to /ventures/{ventureId}/stage/1 ‚Üí Stage1DraftIdea component
- Current: onSuccess ‚Üí refresh venture list ‚Üí user sees new venture ‚Üí clicks it ‚Üí sees... what?
- Venture Detail Page: Shows venture info, but no "Start Stage 1" button visible
- Problem: Dead end after creation, user doesn't know next steps

**WORKFLOW COMPONENT INVENTORY (5 key components, 68KB, 2329 LOC)**:
- CompleteWorkflowOrchestrator.tsx: 31KB, 916 LOC - main workflow engine, multi-stage coordinator
- DynamicStageRenderer.tsx: 14KB, 408 LOC - dynamically loads stage components by number
- StageConfigurationForm.tsx: 22KB, 665 LOC - configure stage settings, validations
- WorkflowProgress.tsx: 13KB, 382 LOC - progress visualization, % complete, stage badges
- WorkflowStageMap.tsx: 8.9KB, 258 LOC - visual workflow map, stage dependencies
- Status: All components built, tested in isolation, NOT integrated with venture creation
- Integration Point: Need to call CompleteWorkflowOrchestrator after venture creation, pass ventureId`,

    scope: `**8-Week Venture Creation & Workflow Integration**:

**PHASE 1: Dialog Consolidation (Week 1)**
- Choose canonical dialog: VentureCreationDialog.tsx (361 LOC, most complete)
- Migrate features from other 2 dialogs if any unique
- Delete CreateVentureDialog.tsx, VentureCreateDialog.tsx
- Update all imports to use VentureCreationDialog

**PHASE 2: ScaffoldStage1 Implementation (Weeks 2-3)**
- Implement real scaffoldStage1() function:
  - Create workflow_executions entry
  - Initialize stage_data for Stage 1
  - Set venture.current_stage = 1
  - Return navigation URL
- Test: Create venture ‚Üí scaffoldStage1 ‚Üí verify workflow created

**PHASE 3: Stage1 Integration (Weeks 3-4)**
- Update VentureCreationDialog: After creation, navigate to /ventures/{id}/stage/1
- Ensure Stage1DraftIdea component loads at that route
- Pre-populate Stage1 form with data from creation dialog (title, description, category)
- Test: Create venture ‚Üí redirected to Stage1 ‚Üí form pre-filled ‚Üí complete ‚Üí data saved

**PHASE 4: Workflow Orchestration (Weeks 5-7)**
- Wire CompleteWorkflowOrchestrator to venture creation flow
- Implement stage progression logic: Stage1 complete ‚Üí Stage2 ‚Üí ... ‚Üí Stage40
- Add workflow status to venture detail page (progress bar, current stage badge)
- Test: Complete Stage1 ‚Üí verify Stage2 auto-triggers

**PHASE 5: Navigation & UX Polish (Week 8)**
- Add "Continue to Stage N" buttons on venture detail page
- Implement stage completion checkmarks
- Add workflow progress visualization
- Test: Full venture lifecycle (create ‚Üí Stage1 ‚Üí ... ‚Üí Stage40 ‚Üí complete)

**OUT OF SCOPE**:
- ‚ùå AI-driven stage progression (defer to separate SD)
- ‚ùå Multi-user workflow collaboration (covered in SD-REALTIME-001)
- ‚ùå Workflow templates/customization (defer to v2)`,

    key_principles: [
      "**Single Source of Truth**: One canonical venture creation dialog (VentureCreationDialog), not 3 - reduce code duplication, eliminate inconsistencies",
      "**Progressive Disclosure**: Start simple (basic dialog), then deep dive (Stage1 21 inputs) - don't overwhelm users upfront, guide step-by-step",
      "**Workflow as First-Class Citizen**: Every venture MUST have workflow from creation - no orphans, no manual stage assignment, orchestrator is mandatory",
      "**Stage1 is Special**: Most detailed stage (21 inputs, voice, strategic context) - venture creation is gateway, Stage1 is foundation, can't skip",
      "**Navigation Continuity**: Create ‚Üí Stage1 ‚Üí Stage2 ‚Üí ... ‚Üí Stage40 ‚Üí Complete - no dead ends, always show next step, clear progress indicators",
      "**Database-Driven Workflow**: workflow_executions table is source of truth for stage progression - not UI state, not local storage, always in sync",
      "**Fail-Safe Scaffolding**: scaffoldStage1() must succeed or roll back venture creation - no partial states, transaction integrity critical",
      "**Workflow Components Active, Not Dormant**: 68KB of orchestration code must be used, not just exist - justify investment, deliver value"
