    description: `Connect fully-built FirstRunWizard (542 LOC, 20KB) to application entry point, creating guided onboarding for new users with demo/clean mode options, preventing empty-state confusion. Currently, new users land in empty application with no guidance, causing high bounce rate and poor first impressions. FirstRunWizard complete with 5-step flow (welcome ‚Üí choice ‚Üí config ‚Üí confirm), demo data seeding (20 ventures via generateMockVentures()), clean slate handling, localStorage persistence, BUT 0 imports - wizard never renders.

**CURRENT STATE - COMPLETE ONBOARDING SITTING DARK**:
- ‚úÖ FirstRunWizard: 542 LOC, 20KB complete React component with Dialog UI
- ‚úÖ 5-step wizard flow: welcome (intro) ‚Üí choice (demo/clean) ‚Üí demo-config/clean-config (options) ‚Üí confirm (review) ‚Üí complete
- ‚úÖ Demo mode: Inserts 20 mock ventures via generateMockVentures(), 2 demo companies, marks is_demo=true for cleanup
- ‚úÖ Clean mode: Empty state with guidance, localStorage flag set, ready for real ventures
- ‚úÖ Empty state detection: checkFirstRun() queries ventures table, shows wizard if 0 ventures + no completion flag
- ‚úÖ localStorage persistence: ehg_wizard_completed (demo/clean/skip), ehg_demo_mode (true/false)
- ‚úÖ Configurable demo options: includeVentures, includeCompanies, includeMetrics, autoProgress checkboxes
- ‚ùå ZERO integration: 0 imports means wizard never shown, users land in empty app with no help
- ‚ùå No App.tsx integration: FirstRunWizard not imported or rendered in application entry point
- ‚ùå No product tour: After wizard, no guided tour of key features (Dashboard, Ventures, Analytics)
- ‚ùå No onboarding progress: Cannot track user activation funnel (wizard seen ‚Üí completed ‚Üí first venture created)
- ‚ùå No cleanup UI: Demo data marked is_demo=true, but no settings UI to remove it
- ‚ùå No re-trigger mechanism: Once wizard_completed flag set, cannot show wizard again (e.g., for reset)

**FIRSTRUNWIZARD ANALYSIS (542 LOC, 20KB)**:

**5-Step Wizard Flow**:
1. **welcome** (Lines 193-231): Intro screen with Rocket icon, "Skip for now" or "Get Started" buttons
2. **choice** (Lines 233-315): Radio cards for Demo Mode (GraduationCap icon, recommended for new users, 20 sample ventures) vs Clean Slate (Sparkles icon, for production)
3. **demo-config** (Lines 317-420): Checkboxes for includeVentures, includeCompanies, includeMetrics, autoProgress, Alert shows is_demo flag
4. **clean-config** (Lines 422-463): Confirmation screen showing clean slate benefits (no data, clean metrics, production-ready)
5. **confirm** (Lines 465-530): Review selection, Back button, "Confirm & Start" with loading state

**Demo Data Seeding (Lines 79-157)**:
- insertDemoData(): Calls generateMockVentures() from @/data/mockVentures (20 ventures)
- Companies: Inserts 2 demo companies ('Demo Ventures Inc', 'Innovation Labs') with is_demo=true
- Ventures: Maps mockVentures to venture table schema (id, name, description, status, current_workflow_stage, industry, ai_score, risk_score, metadata, is_demo=true)
- Toast: "Successfully loaded 20 demo ventures"
- localStorage: Sets ehg_demo_mode='true'

**Empty State Detection (Lines 55-68)**:
- checkFirstRun(): Queries SELECT id FROM ventures LIMIT 1
- If no ventures AND no localStorage.getItem('ehg_wizard_completed'), shows wizard
- Runs in useEffect on component mount

**GAPS IDENTIFIED**:
1. **No App.tsx Integration**: FirstRunWizard not imported in App.tsx, never rendered
2. **No Product Tour**: After wizard completes, no guided tour of Dashboard, Ventures, Workflow, Analytics
3. **No Progress Tracking**: Cannot measure activation funnel (wizard completion rate, demo vs clean choice, first venture creation rate)
4. **No Demo Cleanup UI**: is_demo=true flag exists, but no settings page to bulk delete demo data
5. **No Wizard Reset**: localStorage flag permanent, cannot re-trigger wizard (useful for testing or user reset)
6. **No Feature Highlights**: Wizard mentions features ("Pre-populated ventures", "Sample metrics") but doesn't explain what they do
7. **No Skip Consequences**: "Skip for now" button exists, but user lands in empty app with no next steps`,

    scope: `**4-Week First-Run Experience Implementation**:

**PHASE 1: App.tsx Integration (Week 1)**
- Import FirstRunWizard in App.tsx
- Render wizard conditionally on app load
- Handle onComplete callback (demo/clean/skip)
- Add wizard completion tracking to database

**PHASE 2: Product Tour (Week 2)**
- Create ProductTour component with react-joyride or intro.js
- Define 7-step tour: Dashboard ‚Üí Ventures ‚Üí Create Venture ‚Üí Workflow ‚Üí Analytics ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Complete
- Trigger tour after wizard completion (demo mode)
- Add skip tour option

**PHASE 3: Demo Cleanup & Management (Week 3)**
- Add Demo Data Manager to Settings
- Display demo venture count, cleanup button
- Bulk delete WHERE is_demo=true
- Reset wizard option

**PHASE 4: Progress Tracking & Analytics (Week 4)**
- Create user_onboarding_progress table
- Track wizard steps, completion, mode choice
- Track first venture creation timestamp
- Build onboarding analytics dashboard

**OUT OF SCOPE**:
- ‚ùå Advanced tour customization (tooltips, arrows sufficient)
- ‚ùå Video tutorials (written guides sufficient)
- ‚ùå Multi-step product tours (single tour sufficient)`,

    strategic_objectives: [
      "Integrate FirstRunWizard into App.tsx entry point, rendering wizard on first load for users with 0 ventures and no completion flag, preventing empty-state confusion",
      "Build ProductTour component with 7-step guided tour (Dashboard, Ventures, Create, Workflow, Analytics, Settings, Complete) using react-joyride, triggering after wizard completion",
      "Create Demo Data Manager in Settings: Display demo venture count, bulk cleanup button (DELETE WHERE is_demo=true), wizard reset option to re-trigger FirstRunWizard",
      "Implement onboarding progress tracking: Create user_onboarding_progress table (wizard_seen, wizard_completed, mode_choice, first_venture_created_at), measure activation funnel",
      "Enhance wizard UX: Add feature highlights (explain what Dashboard/Analytics do), improve skip consequences (show next steps), add 'Learn More' tooltips",
      "Achieve 80%+ wizard completion: Target 80% of new users complete wizard (not skip), ‚â•60% choose demo mode, ‚â•50% create first venture within 7 days",
      "Reduce time-to-first-value: From current 'never' (empty app) to <5 minutes (wizard + tour + first venture created), demonstrating product value immediately"
    ],

    success_criteria: [
      "‚úÖ FirstRunWizard integrated: Imported in App.tsx, renders on first load, onComplete handler functional, wizard completion persists",
      "‚úÖ Empty state prevention: New users see wizard, not empty app, ‚â•95% of first-time users see wizard (track with analytics)",
      "‚úÖ Demo data functional: Demo mode creates 20 ventures successfully, ventures marked is_demo=true, data visible in Dashboard/Ventures",
      "‚úÖ Clean mode functional: Clean mode shows empty state guidance, provides 'Create First Venture' CTA, no demo data inserted",
      "‚úÖ ProductTour operational: 7-step tour triggers after wizard, highlights Dashboard/Ventures/Analytics, skip option works, completion tracked",
      "‚úÖ Demo cleanup available: Settings has Demo Data Manager, shows count (e.g., '20 demo ventures'), cleanup button deletes WHERE is_demo=true, confirmation dialog",
      "‚úÖ Progress tracked: user_onboarding_progress table populated, wizard completion rate ‚â•80%, demo mode choice ‚â•60%, first venture creation ‚â•50% within 7 days",
      "‚úÖ Wizard completion rate: ‚â•80% of new users complete wizard (not skip), measured via user_onboarding_progress.wizard_completed",
      "‚úÖ Time-to-first-value: ‚â•50% of users create first venture within 5 minutes of completing wizard (demo or real venture)",
      "‚úÖ User activation: ‚â•70% of wizard completers become activated users (‚â•3 ventures created, ‚â•5 dashboard views within 30 days)"
    ],

    key_principles: [
      "**First Impression Critical**: Users decide product value in first 60 seconds - wizard must show value immediately via demo data or clear next steps",
      "**Choice Empowers**: Offer demo (learn) vs clean (do) modes - users control experience, not forced into demo they don't want",
      "**Demo Data Discoverable**: All demo data marked is_demo=true, cleanup easy, transparency builds trust ('You can remove this anytime')",
      "**Progressive Disclosure**: Wizard ‚Üí Tour ‚Üí First Venture - layer guidance, don't overwhelm, user learns incrementally",
      "**Skip Respects Time**: 'Skip for now' is valid choice for experienced users, but must provide next steps (not empty void)",
      "**Wizard Skippable But Recommended**: Don't force wizard, but strongly recommend ('Recommended for new users' badge), track skip rate to optimize",
      "**Track Everything**: Measure wizard completion, mode choice, tour completion, first venture creation - data drives optimization",
      "**Performance Budget**: Wizard load <500ms, demo data insert <3s, tour navigation <100ms - onboarding must feel instant"
