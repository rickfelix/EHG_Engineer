   - Action: Review, integrate, or remove unused components
   - Outcome: Clean codebase, no orphaned code

3. **Unit Test Infrastructure** (Priority: MEDIUM)
   - Current: 0 unit tests
   - Target: Service layer testing framework established
   - Minimum: 10 unit tests for core business logic

## Sprint 4 Detailed Scope

### Phase 1: E2E Test Hardening (Days 1-2)

**Objective:** Fix 12 failing E2E tests to achieve 80%+ coverage

**Current Failures (from E2E_TESTING_SESSION_SUMMARY.md):**
1. Dynamic content timing issues
2. waitForSelector timeouts
3. Form submission validation edge cases
4. Navigation state management
5. Modal rendering race conditions

**Actions:**
1. **Analyze Test Failures**
   - Review Playwright trace files
   - Identify common failure patterns
   - Group by root cause

2. **Implement Fixes**
   - Add explicit waitFor conditions
   - Implement retry logic for dynamic content
   - Use test-specific data attributes
   - Add network idle waits for async operations

3. **Test Infrastructure Improvements**
   - Create reusable test helpers
   - Add screenshot capture on failures
   - Implement video recording for debugging
   - Document test patterns in wiki

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ 21/26 tests passing (80%+ coverage)
- ✅ All tests documented with clear Given-When-Then
- ✅ Test execution time <5 minutes
- ✅ Zero flaky tests (consistent pass/fail)

**Estimated Effort:** 8-12 hours

### Phase 2: Component Integration Audit (Day 2-3)

**Objective:** Resolve 9 unintegrated components

**QA Director Findings:**
- 9 components built but not imported in main application
- Potential technical debt accumulation
- Unclear which components are needed vs abandoned

**Actions:**
1. **Discovery**
   ```bash
   # Find all .tsx/.jsx components in src/components/agents/
   # Cross-reference with imports in main app files
   # Generate list of orphaned components
   ```

2. **Categorization**
   - **Category A:** Should be integrated (missing features)
   - **Category B:** Duplicate/obsolete (safe to delete)
   - **Category C:** Future use (document and preserve)

3. **Integration or Cleanup**
   - Integrate Category A components
   - Delete Category B components
   - Document Category C components in backlog

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ 0 unintegrated components in Category A
- ✅ Category B components removed
- ✅ Category C components documented with justification
- ✅ Component dependency graph updated

**Estimated Effort:** 4-6 hours

---

### Phase 3: Unit Test Infrastructure (Day 3-4)

**Objective:** Establish unit testing foundation

**Current State:** 0 unit tests (service layer doesn't exist yet)

**Actions:**
1. **Create Service Layer**
   - Extract business logic from ABTestingTab component
   - Create `abTestingService.ts`
   - Implement CRUD operations for A/B tests

2. **Set Up Vitest**
   - Configure vitest.config.ts
   - Create test setup files
   - Add testing utilities (mocks, fixtures)

3. **Write Core Unit Tests**
   - Test A/B test variant validation
   - Test audience targeting logic
   - Test duration calculations
   - Test data transformations

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Service layer created (200-300 LOC)
- ✅ 10+ unit tests written
- ✅ 50%+ code coverage for service layer
- ✅ Tests run in <10 seconds

**Estimated Effort:** 6-8 hours

---

### Phase 4: Feature Delivery (Day 4-5)

**Objective:** Continue progress on remaining user stories

**Remaining User Stories:** 38 (from 57 total)

**Sprint 4 Target:** 8-10 additional stories

**Prioritized Stories (from PRD):**
1. A/B test results visualization (charts/graphs)
2. Test performance metrics dashboard
3. Winner determination algorithm
4. Auto-stop on statistical significance
5. Test cloning functionality
6. Historical test archive
7. Test comparison tool
8. Export test data (CSV/JSON)

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ 8-10 stories completed
- ✅ All new features have E2E tests
- ✅ Code review completed
- ✅ Documentation updated

**Estimated Effort:** 10-12 hours

---

## Sprint 4 Success Metrics

### Quality Gates (MANDATORY)

1. **E2E Coverage:** ≥80% (21/26 tests passing)
2. **Unit Coverage:** ≥50% for service layer
3. **QA Verdict:** PASS (85%+ confidence)
4. **Component Health:** 0 unintegrated components
5. **Test Stability:** 0 flaky tests

### Progress Metrics

- **User Stories:** 19 → 27-29 completed (47-51% total progress)
- **SD Progress:** 40% → 50-55%
- **Technical Debt:** Reduced (component cleanup)

### Sprint 4 Exit Criteria

**Ready for Sprint 5 handoff when:**
- ✅ All quality gates met
- ✅ QA Director verdict: PASS
- ✅ PLAN supervisor verdict: PASS or CONDITIONAL_ACCEPT with minor issues
- ✅ No critical blockers identified
- ✅ Sprint 5 scope defined

## Risk Assessment

### High Risks

1. **E2E Test Complexity**
   - Risk: Timeouts and race conditions hard to fix
   - Mitigation: Incremental fixes, focus on highest-impact tests first

2. **Component Integration Scope Creep**
   - Risk: Integrating components reveals missing dependencies
   - Mitigation: Time-box to 6 hours, defer complex integrations to Sprint 5

### Medium Risks

1. **Service Layer Refactoring**
   - Risk: Moving logic from components breaks existing functionality
   - Mitigation: Incremental refactoring, maintain component tests

2. **Test Infrastructure Learning Curve**
   - Risk: Vitest setup and best practices take longer than estimated
   - Mitigation: Use existing patterns from other projects

## Sprint 4 Timeline

| Day | Focus | Deliverables |
|-----|-------|--------------|
| **1** | E2E test fixes (Part 1) | 6 tests fixed, patterns documented |
| **2** | E2E test fixes (Part 2) + Audit start | 6 more tests fixed, component list |
| **3** | Component integration + Unit test setup | Components resolved, Vitest configured |
| **4** | Unit tests + Feature delivery | 10 unit tests, 4 stories complete |
| **5** | Feature delivery + QA | 4-6 more stories, QA Director run |

**Total Estimated Effort:** 28-38 hours (3.5-5 days at 8 hours/day)

## Sprint 4 Retrospective Planning

**Continuous Improvement Focus:**
- E2E testing effectiveness (what worked/didn't work)
- Component organization patterns (prevent future orphans)
- Sprint-based vs full SD approach (lessons learned)
- Test infrastructure scalability

**Questions to Answer:**
1. Did quality-first approach improve confidence?
2. Is 80% E2E coverage realistic for all sprints?
3. Should component audits be part of every sprint DoD?
4. Can unit test development be parallelized with features?

## Next Steps (Sprint 5+ Preview)

**Estimated Remaining Work:**
- Sprint 5: 8-10 stories (cumulative: 35-39 completed, 61-68%)
- Sprint 6: 8-10 stories (cumulative: 43-49 completed, 75-86%)
- Sprint 7: 8-8 stories (cumulative: 51-57 completed, 89-100%)

**Projected Completion:** 3-4 more sprints after Sprint 4

**Sprint 4 Status:** PLANNING COMPLETE
**Ready to Execute:** YES
