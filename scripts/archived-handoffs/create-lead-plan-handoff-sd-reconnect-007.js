    // 1. Executive Summary
    executive_summary: `SD-RECONNECT-007: Comprehensive Component Library Integration - Strategic Expansion

**Scope Evolution**: Originally identified 4 disconnected components. Comprehensive audit revealed 45 total disconnected components representing significant unlocked platform value.

**Strategic Decision**: EXPAND scope from 4 to 45 components based on user directive for thoroughness over speed. All components verified in EHG application only (not EHG_Engineer).

**Business Value**:
- Unlock 45 sophisticated features currently inaccessible to users
- Improve platform utilization from ~18% to ~100% of built capabilities
- Enhance user experience with comprehensive feature access
- Demonstrate platform maturity and completeness

**Component Breakdown**:
- Tier 1 (16 dashboards): Ready with database/hooks - immediate integration
- Tier 2 (7 dashboards): Need backend setup - moderate effort
- Tier 3 (22 components): Panels, engines, systems - analyze standalone vs embedded

**Database Analysis** (Principal Database Architect):
- 9 of 13 required tables EXIST (business_agents, knowledge_base_articles, generated_docs, eva_analytics, eva_compliance_logs, integration_status, access_reviews, data_governance_policies, data_lifecycle_stages)
- 4 tables need creation (exploration_branches, opportunity_signals, timing_optimizations, security_incidents)
- Impact: Low - minimal schema work required

**Target Application**: EHG (/mnt/c/_EHG/ehg/) - customer-facing app
**Priority**: HIGH (significant platform value unlock)
**Complexity**: Medium-High (45 components, but most infrastructure exists)`,

    // 2. Deliverables Manifest
    deliverables_manifest: `**LEAD Phase Deliverables** ✅

1. **Strategic Directive Expansion**
   - SD-RECONNECT-007 metadata updated (scope: 4 → 45 components)
   - Component inventory documented (23 dashboards + 22 other components)
   - 3-tier integration approach defined
   - Target application confirmed: /mnt/c/_EHG/ehg/

2. **Comprehensive Component Audit**
   - 31 total dashboard components discovered in EHG app
   - 8 dashboards already connected (baseline)
   - 23 dashboards disconnected (need integration)
   - 22 other components identified (panels, engines, systems)
   - All verified as EHG-only (NOT in EHG_Engineer)

3. **Database Schema Analysis** (Principal Database Architect Sub-Agent)
   - 13 critical tables assessed
   - 9 tables confirmed existing
   - 4 tables identified for creation
   - Migration strategy defined

4. **Tier-Based Categorization**
   **Tier 1 - Ready for Integration (16):**
   - AIDocsAdminDashboard, KnowledgeManagementDashboard, ParallelExplorationDashboard
   - TimingOptimizationDashboard, EVAAnalyticsDashboard, EVAOrchestrationDashboard
   - LivePerformanceDashboard, OpportunitySourcingDashboard, TestingAutomationDashboard
   - DataGovernanceDashboard, DataLifecycleDashboard, GovernanceDashboard
   - AccessReviewDashboard, SecurityDashboard, IntegrationStatusDashboard
   - AuthenticationDashboard

   **Tier 2 - Backend Setup Needed (7):**
   - ProfitabilityDashboard, ExecutiveDashboard, EVAComplianceDashboard
   - RealTimeAnalyticsDashboard, ValidationDashboard, StageAnalysisDashboard
   - ComprehensiveSecurityDashboard

   **Tier 3 - Integration Analysis Required (22):**
   - 8 Panels, 8 Engines, 6 Systems/Hubs/Managers

5. **Risk Assessment & Mitigation**
   - Navigation UX complexity (45 new routes) → Logical grouping + collapsible sections
   - Testing coverage time → Automated tier-based testing + systematic manual validation
   - Schema dependencies → Create migrations in PLAN phase, test before EXEC
   - Potential deprecated components → PLAN evaluation per component`,

    // 3. Key Decisions & Rationale
    key_decisions: `**Decision 1: Scope Expansion from 4 to 45 Components** ✅
Rationale: User explicitly requested thoroughness over speed ("I want it all"). Comprehensive audit revealed 41 additional disconnected components. Expanding scope unlocks maximum platform value in single SD execution.
Impact: Transforms SD-RECONNECT-007 from tactical fix to strategic platform completion initiative.

**Decision 2: 3-Tier Rollout Strategy**
Rationale: Prioritize components by technical readiness to minimize risk and enable incremental testing. Tier 1 (ready) → Tier 2 (backend work) → Tier 3 (analysis needed).
Impact: Faster time-to-value, controlled complexity escalation, clear progress milestones.

**Decision 3: Database-First Integration Approach**
Rationale: Ensure all schemas exist BEFORE creating routes/pages to prevent runtime errors. Principal Database Architect analysis shows only 4 new schemas needed (low risk).
Impact: Solid data foundation, prevents integration failures, follows best practices.

**Decision 4: Logical Navigation Grouping**
Rationale: 45 new routes require thoughtful organization to avoid overwhelming users. Group by domain (AI & Orchestration, Analytics, Governance, etc.) with collapsible sections.
Impact: Maintainable navigation UX, scalable for future additions, intuitive user experience.

**Decision 5: Tier 3 Integration Pattern Analysis**
Rationale: 22 Tier 3 components may be better embedded in existing pages vs standalone routes. PLAN phase will evaluate each component's integration pattern (standalone/embedded/modal).
Impact: Right-sized integration, avoids route proliferation, optimizes user workflows.

**Decision 6: Simplicity-First PLAN Review**
Rationale: Despite 45 components, apply LEAD simplicity lens. PLAN should evaluate if any components are over-engineered or deprecated, recommend scope reduction if appropriate.
Impact: Maintains quality over quantity, ensures only valuable features are integrated.

**Deferred Decisions for PLAN Phase**:
- Specific database migration file creation for 4 missing schemas
- Exact URL structure for 45 routes
- Navigation menu hierarchy and grouping labels
- Tier 3 component integration patterns (standalone vs embedded vs modal)
- Test strategy and acceptance criteria per tier`,

    //4. Known Issues & Risks
    known_issues: `**Risk 1: Navigation Menu Overwhelm** [MEDIUM]
Issue: Adding 45 new menu items could create cluttered, overwhelming navigation UX.
Mitigation: Logical domain grouping (6-8 categories), collapsible sections, search functionality, breadcrumb navigation.
Trigger: Design Sub-Agent review during PLAN phase.

**Risk 2: Testing Coverage Time** [MEDIUM]
Issue: Manual testing of 45 components end-to-end is time-intensive (estimated 6-8 hours).
Mitigation: Automated tests per tier, systematic manual validation checklist, parallel testing where possible.
Owner: QA Engineering Director sub-agent (PLAN phase).

**Risk 3: Schema Migration Failures** [LOW]
Issue: 4 new table creations could fail due to constraints, naming conflicts, or permissions.
Mitigation: Test migrations in development first, use transaction rollback, verify with Database Architect.
Contingency: Manual schema review and adjustment if automated migration fails.

**Risk 4: Deprecated Component Discovery** [LOW]
Issue: Some disconnected components may be intentionally unused (deprecated features).
Mitigation: PLAN evaluation includes checking component last-modified dates, git history, and business value.
Action: Recommend deprecation/removal if component is obsolete rather than forcing integration.

**Risk 5: Server Restart Protocol Compliance** [MEDIUM]
Issue: 45 component integrations require multiple server restarts. Missing restarts = changes not visible.
Mitigation: Mandatory restart checklist after each tier, automated restart script, verification screenshots.
Critical: Build React client (npm run build) BEFORE server restart.

**Risk 6: Database Permissions** [LOW]
Issue: EHG database may have permission restrictions preventing table creation.
Mitigation: Use pooler connection with correct credentials, test migration on single table first, have manual SQL ready as backup.
Reference: apply-demo-migration-pg.js in EHG scripts directory (working pattern)`,
