  // Element 1: Executive Summary
  executive_summary: `**SD-BACKEND-001: Critical UI Stub Completion (LEAD Approved - Reduced Scope)**

**Status**: LEAD approval complete, ready for PLAN phase
**Scope Decision**: Approved with 25% reduction (180-280h vs 240-320h)
**Priority**: Critical (fixes false advertising, competitive requirement)

**Approved Features** (2 of 4):
1. ✅ EVA Realtime Voice (80-120h) - Core AI differentiation, UD: 8/10, BV: 9/10
2. ✅ Chairman Export PDF (40-60h) - Executive critical need, UD: 9/10, BV: 8/10

**Deferred Features** (2 of 4):
3. ⏸️ Excel Export → SD-BACKEND-001A (UD: 5/10, client-side workaround available)
4. ⏸️ Configure Dashboard → SD-BACKEND-001B (UD: 4/10, default layout sufficient)

**LEAD Decision Rationale**:
- Simplicity gate applied: Focused on high-impact features (Voice + PDF)
- 80/20 rule: Approved features deliver 90% of user value
- User demand threshold enforced: Only features with UD ≥8/10 approved
- Business value threshold enforced: Only features with BV ≥8/10 approved
- Scope reduction: Deferred 50% of features for 25% effort savings

**Business Impact**:
- Fixes critical UX failure (non-functional UI stubs)
- Restores user trust (no more false expectations)
- Achieves competitive parity (voice AI, executive reporting)
- Reduces executive frustration (PDF export functional)

**Next Phase**: PLAN to create comprehensive PRD with test plans for approved scope`,

**Outstanding Items**: None - LEAD phase complete

**Handoff Status**: READY FOR PLAN`,

  // Element 3: Deliverables Manifest
  deliverables_manifest: `**LEAD Deliverables** (All Complete):

1. **Strategic Assessment Document** ✅
   - File: reports/SD-BACKEND-001-LEAD-STRATEGIC-ASSESSMENT.md
   - Content: Simplicity gate analysis, scope decisions, BV/UD scores
   - Status: Complete

2. **Database Updates** ✅
   - SD-BACKEND-001: status = active, progress = 10%, scope updated
   - Approval metadata: LEAD approval, scope reduction, deferred features
   - Status: Complete

3. **Deferred Strategic Directives** ✅
   - SD-BACKEND-001A: Chairman Export Excel (deferred, workaround available)
   - SD-BACKEND-001B: Chairman Dashboard Configure (deferred, default sufficient)
   - Status: Complete

4. **Reduced Scope Definition** ✅
   - EVA Realtime Voice: 80-120h (Weeks 2-4)
   - Chairman Export PDF: 40-60h (Week 5)
   - Architecture & Planning: 40-60h (Week 1)
   - Testing & Deployment: 20-40h (Week 6)
   - Total: 180-280h
   - Status: Complete

5. **LEAD→PLAN Handoff** ✅
   - 7 mandatory elements included
   - Strategic context provided
   - Action items defined
   - Status: In progress (this document)

**Artifacts for PLAN**:
- Approved scope (180-280h)
- Business value scores (9/10 Voice, 8/10 PDF)
- User demand scores (8/10 Voice, 9/10 PDF)
- Technology stack recommendations (WebRTC, Puppeteer)
- Performance targets (<100ms voice latency, <5s PDF export)`,

  // Element 4: Key Decisions & Rationale
  key_decisions: `**LEAD Strategic Decisions**:

**Decision 1: APPROVE SD-BACKEND-001 with Reduced Scope** ✅
- Rationale: High user demand (≥8/10) and high business value (≥8/10) justify investment
- Impact: Fixes critical UX failures, achieves competitive parity
- Alternative rejected: Full scope (240-320h) violates simplicity principle

**Decision 2: DEFER Excel Export (SD-BACKEND-001A)** ⏸️
- Rationale: Low user demand (5/10), client-side workaround available (SheetJS, 8h)
- Impact: Saves 40-60h backend effort
- Re-evaluation: If user demand ≥7/10 or client-side insufficient
- Workaround: Use SheetJS XLSX library for browser-based Excel generation

**Decision 3: DEFER Configure Dashboard (SD-BACKEND-001B)** ⏸️
- Rationale: Low user demand (4/10), default layout serves all users
- Impact: Saves 20-40h effort
- Re-evaluation: If ≥3 customization requests or user demand ≥6/10
- Workaround: Default dashboard layout (already exists, 0h effort)

**Decision 4: Focus on Voice + PDF Export** ✅
- Rationale: 80/20 rule - these 2 features deliver 90% of user value
- Impact: Concentrated effort on high-impact work
- Metrics: Voice (UD: 8/10, BV: 9/10), PDF (UD: 9/10, BV: 8/10)

**Decision 5: Technology Stack Selection** ✅
- Voice: WebRTC + WebSocket (Socket.io) + OpenAI Realtime API
- PDF: Puppeteer (chart rendering) + React SSR
- Rationale: Proven technologies, good performance, developer familiarity
- Alternative rejected: External services (vendor lock-in, ongoing costs)

**Simplicity Principle Applied**:
- ✅ What's the simplest solution? → Defer low-demand features, use workarounds
- ✅ Why not configure existing tools? → Evaluated external services, chose selective use
- ✅ 80/20 rule? → Focused on 2 features that deliver 90% of value

**LEAD Approval Criteria Met**:
- User demand ≥8/10 for approved features ✅
- Business value ≥8/10 for approved features ✅
- Clear business case (fixes false advertising) ✅
- Competitive requirement (voice AI, executive reporting) ✅
- Simplicity gate passed (scope reduced 25%) ✅`,

  // Element 5: Known Issues & Risks
  known_issues_and_risks: `**Technical Risks**:

**HIGH RISK: Voice Latency**
- Issue: WebRTC + OpenAI API round-trip may exceed 200ms p95 target
- Impact: Poor user experience, users prefer typing
- Mitigation: WebSocket for faster transport, optimize audio buffering, performance testing
- Owner: PLAN (architecture) + EXEC (implementation)
- Probability: 40% (WebRTC adds latency)

**HIGH RISK: STT Accuracy**
- Issue: Background noise, accents may reduce accuracy below 95% target
- Impact: Frustrating user experience, incorrect transcripts
- Mitigation: Test with diverse audio samples, add noise cancellation, set expectations
- Owner: PLAN (testing strategy) + EXEC (implementation)
- Probability: 30% (OpenAI Whisper is generally accurate)

**MEDIUM RISK: PDF Chart Rendering Complexity**
- Issue: Server-side rendering of Recharts components may be complex
- Impact: Implementation delays, chart formatting issues
- Mitigation: Use Puppeteer established pattern, test with sample charts
- Owner: PLAN (architecture) + EXEC (implementation)
- Probability: 25% (Puppeteer is well-documented)

**MEDIUM RISK: Concurrent Users Scaling**
- Issue: 100 simultaneous voice sessions may overload server
- Impact: Performance degradation, service outages
- Mitigation: Load testing, horizontal scaling, WebSocket clustering
- Owner: PLAN (infrastructure) + EXEC (deployment)
- Probability: 20% (scalable architecture available)

**LOW RISK: Scope Creep**
- Issue: Users may request additional voice features (TTS, multi-language)
- Impact: Timeline delays, budget overrun
- Mitigation: Fixed scope per LEAD approval, document future enhancements
- Owner: LEAD (enforcement) + PLAN (boundary management)
- Probability: 15% (clear scope defined)

**Known Limitations**:
- Voice: WebRTC requires HTTPS, may not work on all networks (corporate firewalls)
- PDF: Large reports (>100 charts) may timeout
- Both: Require modern browsers (Chrome 80+, Firefox 75+, Safari 14+)

**Assumptions**:
- OpenAI Realtime API availability and pricing remain stable
- Users have adequate bandwidth (>1Mbps for voice)
- Users accept browser-based voice (no native app required)`,

    - Document out-of-scope requests for future SDs
    - Reference deferred features if questions arise

**CRITICAL REMINDERS FOR PLAN**:

⚠️ **Database-First**: Store PRD in database (NOT as file)
⚠️ **Test Plans Required**: Comprehensive E2E, performance, security tests in PRD
⚠️ **Sub-Agent Activation**: Monitor for triggers (design, database, security keywords)
⚠️ **Simplicity**: If PRD seems over-engineered, escalate to LEAD BEFORE EXEC
⚠️ **Scope Locked**: Only Voice + PDF approved, Excel/Configure are deferred
⚠️ **Target Application**: EHG (NOT EHG_Engineer) - verify correct app directory

**Success Criteria for PLAN Phase**:
- ✅ Comprehensive PRD stored in database
- ✅ Architecture diagrams created
- ✅ API specifications defined (OpenAPI/Swagger)
- ✅ Database schema designed with RLS
- ✅ Test plans documented (E2E, performance, security)
- ✅ Sub-agents activated and integrated
- ✅ PLAN→EXEC handoff created with 7 elements
- ✅ SD progress updated to 30%`
