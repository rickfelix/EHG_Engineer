    executive_summary: `SD-REALTIME-001: Real-time Infrastructure - LEAD Approval with SCOPE REDUCTION ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Strategic Decision**: Standardize existing real-time infrastructure instead of "implement for ALL tables"

**Over-Engineering Assessment**:
- Score: 9/30 (CRITICAL OVER-ENGINEERING RISK)
- Original Scope: "Implement real-time for ALL tables" (undefined, unmeasurable)
- Reality: 6 tables already have real-time (collaboration, notifications, business_agents, ai_ceo_agents, performance_logs, actor_messages)
- Red Flags: No user validation, no backlog items, tech-driven not user-driven

**Business Value (Reduced Scope)**:
- Immediate: Audit & document existing real-time patterns (14 files already using .channel)
- Measurable: Create reusable template hook reducing implementation time by 50%
- Strategic: Enable future real-time features with proven patterns

**Technical Foundation Found**:
- ‚úÖ 14 files with Supabase real-time channels
- ‚úÖ 4 core hooks: useCollaboration, useNotifications, useBusinessAgents, useAgents
- ‚úÖ 6 active channels subscribed and working
- ‚úÖ Real-time infrastructure proven in production

**Scope Reduction Rationale**:
Per LEO Protocol LEAD responsibility: "SIMPLICITY FIRST (PRE-APPROVAL ONLY): During initial SD review, challenge complexity and favor simple solutions. Apply 80/20 rule BEFORE approval."

**80/20 Analysis**:
- 80% value: Standardize existing 6 implementations, create template
- 20% effort: Audit, document, template creation
- Deferred: "ALL tables" (unmeasurable), collaborative editing (complex), conflict resolution (separate architecture)`,

    deliverables_manifest: `## LEAD Decisions

### Decision 1: MANDATORY SCOPE REDUCTION (Over-Engineering Score: 9/30)
**Original Scope**: "Implement real-time subscriptions for all data tables, add optimistic updates, create presence indicators, implement collaborative editing with conflict resolution"
**Reduced Scope**: Audit existing infrastructure, standardize patterns, create template
**Rationale**:
  - No backlog items to validate which tables need real-time
  - 6 tables already have working real-time
  - "ALL tables" is undefined and unmeasurable
  - No user problem documented
**Deferred to Future SDs**:
  - Real-time for remaining tables (requires user validation first)
  - Collaborative editing (complex, needs separate architecture SD)
  - Conflict resolution (depends on collaborative editing)

### Decision 2: Phase 1 Deliverables (APPROVED)
**Scope**: Infrastructure audit and standardization
**Components**:
  1. Audit existing 14 files with .channel subscriptions
  2. Document standard patterns from 6 working implementations
  3. Create reusable useRealtimeSubscription hook template
  4. Identify 2-3 high-value tables needing coverage (with user validation)
**Hours**: 8 hours (vs 40+ for "ALL tables")
**Risk**: Low - using existing proven patterns

### Decision 3: Pattern Documentation Strategy
**Approach**: Extract patterns from existing hooks
**Sources**:
  - useCollaboration.ts (collaboration channel)
  - useNotifications.ts (notifications channel)
  - useBusinessAgents.ts (business_agents_changes)
  - useAgents.ts (3 channels: ai_ceo_agents, performance_logs, actor_messages)
**Deliverable**: Markdown guide + TypeScript template hook

### Decision 4: Template Hook Design
**Name**: useRealtimeSubscription<T>
**Features**:
  - Generic type support
  - Built-in error handling
  - Connection state management
  - Optimistic update helpers
  - Presence indicator patterns
**Location**: src/hooks/realtime/useRealtimeSubscription.ts

### Decision 5: Success Metrics (ADDED - was missing)
**Metrics**:
  - Developer velocity: 50% faster real-time implementation (measure setup time)
  - Pattern adoption: 100% of new real-time features use template
  - Code quality: 0 custom subscription logic outside template
  - Documentation: <10 min for new developer to add real-time to a table

## Deliverables for PLAN Phase

1. **Comprehensive PRD** (Focus: Standardization not expansion)
   - FR-001: Infrastructure audit report (14 files analyzed)
   - FR-002: Pattern documentation (6 channels documented)
   - FR-003: useRealtimeSubscription hook template
   - FR-004: Migration guide (convert existing to template)
   - FR-005: High-value table identification (2-3 tables max)
   - NFR-001: Zero breaking changes to existing real-time
   - NFR-002: Template supports all existing use cases
   - AC-001: Template hook passes TypeScript strict mode
   - AC-002: Documentation includes working examples

2. **Infrastructure Analysis**
   - File-by-file audit of 14 real-time implementations
   - Pattern commonalities report
   - Anti-pattern identification
   - Performance baseline metrics

3. **Technical Architecture**
   - Component structure: hooks/realtime/ directory
   - Template hook with generics
   - Documentation strategy
   - Rollout plan for existing hooks

4. **Principal Systems Analyst Sub-Agent** (MANDATORY)
   - Validate no duplicate real-time implementations exist
   - Check for conflicting patterns across 14 files
   - Assess technical debt in current implementations
   - Identify standardization opportunities

5. **Design Sub-Agent Review** (Optional - only if UI changes needed)
   - Presence indicator patterns (if implementing new UI)
   - Loading state standards for real-time updates

## Constraints & Risks

**Constraints**:
- ZERO breaking changes to existing 6 working channels
- Must support all current use cases
- Template must be simpler than current implementations

**Risks**:
- Low: Refactoring working code (mitigation: comprehensive tests)
- Low: Pattern doesn't fit all use cases (mitigation: keep escape hatch)

**Out of Scope** (Explicitly Deferred):
- ‚ùå Implementing real-time for "ALL tables" (undefined, unmeasurable)
- ‚ùå Collaborative editing (needs architecture SD)
- ‚ùå Conflict resolution (depends on collab editing)
- ‚ùå Optimistic updates (too broad, needs user stories)`,

    key_decisions: `## Strategic Decisions

1. **Over-Engineering Prevention**
   - Applied LEAD rubric: scored 9/30 (critical over-engineering)
   - Reduced "ALL tables" scope to "audit + standardize existing"
   - Deferred collaborative editing to separate SD

2. **80/20 Rule Application**
   - 80% value: Standardize 6 working implementations
   - 20% effort: Document patterns, create template
   - ROI: 50% faster future implementations

3. **Risk Mitigation**
   - Zero breaking changes requirement
   - Comprehensive test coverage for template
   - Gradual rollout with existing hooks

4. **Success Definition**
   - NOT: "All tables have real-time"
   - INSTEAD: "Real-time follows standard pattern, devs can add in <10 min"

5. **User Validation Deferred**
   - Original scope had no user problem statement
   - Phase 1: Audit and template
   - Phase 2 (future SD): Identify user needs, then extend

## Technical Decisions

1. **Template Hook Architecture**
   - Generic TypeScript: useRealtimeSubscription<T>
   - Supports all 6 current channel types
   - Built-in error handling and reconnection logic

2. **Pattern Extraction**
   - Source: 4 existing hooks (useCollaboration, useNotifications, useBusinessAgents, useAgents)
   - Method: Identify commonalities, extract to template
   - Preserve: Escape hatches for edge cases

3. **Documentation Strategy**
   - Developer guide with examples
   - Migration path for existing implementations
   - Decision tree: "When to use real-time vs polling"

4. **Rollout Plan**
   - Phase 1: Create template
   - Phase 2: Convert 1 existing hook as proof
   - Phase 3: Document and enable team adoption`,

    known_issues: `## Known Issues

1. **No Backlog Items** ‚ö†Ô∏è
   - SD has 0 backlog items
   - Original scope not validated by user stories
   - Mitigation: Reduced scope to infrastructure work only

2. **No User Problem Statement** ‚ö†Ô∏è
   - Tech-driven, not user-driven
   - Success metrics were missing (added by LEAD)
   - Mitigation: Focus on developer experience improvements

3. **"ALL tables" Undefined** ‚ö†Ô∏è
   - Original scope: "implement for all data tables"
   - Database has 50+ tables, most don't need real-time
   - Mitigation: Deferred to future SD with proper validation

4. **Existing Infrastructure Not Documented** ‚ö†Ô∏è
   - 14 files with real-time, but no central documentation
   - Risk: Developers duplicate patterns instead of reusing
   - Mitigation: Phase 1 focuses on documentation

5. **Collaborative Editing Complexity** ‚ö†Ô∏è
   - Original scope included "conflict resolution"
   - Requires CRDT or OT algorithms (complex)
   - Mitigation: Deferred to separate architecture SD

## Risks

1. **Refactoring Working Code** (Low Risk)
   - 6 channels currently working in production
   - Risk: Breaking changes during standardization
   - Mitigation: Zero breaking changes requirement + comprehensive tests

2. **Template Doesn't Fit All Cases** (Low Risk)
   - Risk: One-size-fits-all template too rigid
   - Mitigation: Keep escape hatch, allow custom implementations

3. **Adoption Resistance** (Medium Risk)
   - Risk: Developers continue using custom patterns
   - Mitigation: Clear docs, migration guide, PR reviews enforce standards`,

    resource_utilization: `## Phase: LEAD
- **Time Spent**: 45 minutes
- **Key Activities**:
  - 5-step SD evaluation (metadata, PRD check, backlog review, infrastructure search, gap analysis)
  - Over-engineering rubric assessment (scored 9/30)
  - Infrastructure inventory (found 14 files, 6 channels)
  - Scope reduction analysis
  - Handoff creation

## Resources for PLAN Phase

**Estimated Hours**: 8 hours total
- Infrastructure audit: 2 hours (analyze 14 files)
- Pattern documentation: 2 hours (extract from 6 implementations)
- Template hook development: 3 hours (useRealtimeSubscription with generics)
- PRD creation: 1 hour (acceptance criteria, migration plan)

**Sub-Agents Required**:
- Principal Systems Analyst: Check for duplicates/conflicts (30 min)
- (Optional) Design Sub-Agent: Only if UI changes needed (not expected)

**Files to Review**:
1. src/hooks/useCollaboration.ts (collaboration channel)
2. src/hooks/useNotifications.ts (notifications channel)
3. src/hooks/useBusinessAgents.ts (business_agents_changes)
4. src/hooks/useAgents.ts (3 channels)
5. 10 additional files with .channel patterns

**Tools Needed**:
- TypeScript (existing)
- Supabase client (existing)
- React hooks (existing)
- Jest for testing (existing)`,

    action_items: `## For PLAN Agent

### Immediate Actions (Required)
1. ‚úÖ Accept this handoff and validate 7 mandatory elements present
2. ‚úÖ Create comprehensive PRD focusing on standardization not expansion
3. ‚úÖ Trigger Principal Systems Analyst sub-agent to check for duplicates
4. ‚úÖ Query backlog (will be empty, document this gap)
5. ‚úÖ Design template hook architecture with generics

### PRD Requirements
- Must include infrastructure audit plan (14 files)
- Must define pattern extraction methodology
- Must specify template hook API (useRealtimeSubscription<T>)
- Must include migration guide for existing hooks
- Must have success metrics (developer velocity improvement)

### Sub-Agent Coordination
1. **Principal Systems Analyst** (MANDATORY):
   - Trigger phrase: "existing implementation"
   - Goal: Validate no conflicting real-time patterns
   - Deliverable: Standardization opportunities report

2. **Design Sub-Agent** (SKIP - no UI changes expected):
   - Only needed if presence indicators or loading states change

### PLAN‚ÜíEXEC Handoff Requirements
- Template hook implementation spec
- Test coverage requirements (>80%)
- Migration rollout plan
- Documentation structure

### Critical Reminders
- ‚ö†Ô∏è ZERO breaking changes to existing 6 channels
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Template must support all current use cases
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Focus is standardization, NOT expansion to new tables
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Success = developer velocity improvement, NOT "all tables covered"

### Verification Criteria
Before moving to EXEC, PLAN must confirm:
- [ ] PRD addresses audit, documentation, template creation
- [ ] PRD does NOT include "implement for ALL tables"
- [ ] Sub-agent analysis complete
- [ ] Zero breaking changes validated
- [ ] Success metrics defined and measurable`
