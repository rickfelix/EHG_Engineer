    description: `Systematic reconnection of 9 major feature platforms representing $500K-$1M in development investment that are fully built but completely inaccessible to users. CRITICAL business value gap where production-ready platforms have no routes or navigation entries.

**CURRENT STATE - CRITICAL ACCESSIBILITY GAP**:
- ‚úÖ 9 complete feature platforms with 40+ components built
- ‚úÖ Services, hooks, and business logic fully implemented
- ‚úÖ TypeScript types and interfaces defined
- ‚ùå ZERO routes configured in App.tsx (643 lines, 0 platform routes)
- ‚ùå ZERO navigation menu entries for platforms
- ‚ùå User access to features: <20% (should be >95%)
- ‚ùå Estimated hidden value: $500K-$1M in sunk development costs

**DISCONNECTED PLATFORMS**:
1. **AI CEO Agent** (3 components): Executive decision support, board reporting, strategic initiatives
2. **Competitive Intelligence** (4 components): Market analysis, competitor tracking, benchmarking
3. **Creative Media Automation** (3 components): Content generation, video pipeline, optimization
4. **GTM Strategist** (components found): Go-to-market planning and execution
5. **Feedback Loops System** (5 components): Customer feedback analysis, satisfaction tracking
6. **Gap Analysis System** (components found): Strategic planning and gap identification
7. **Quality Assurance Platform** (components found): Testing automation and quality metrics
8. **Strategic Naming System** (components found): Development standards and naming conventions
9. **Mobile Companion App** (components to be found): Wearable integration and mobile features

**TARGET OUTCOME**:
- 9 new routes in App.tsx with lazy loading
- Navigation menu updated with categorized platform entries
- Feature discovery mechanism for users
