  description: 'Build automated connectivity testing infrastructure to prevent future feature disconnections. **CURRENT STATE**: Strong test foundation exists (77 test files across e2e/unit/integration/a11y/performance/security/visual categories, Playwright configured with 12 e2e tests, CI/CD pipeline with lint/type-check/unit/integration/accessibility tests). **COVERAGE GAPS**: 10 Next.js pages and 26 API routes lack automated route coverage validation, navigation path checking, orphaned component detection, and import reference tracking. **MISSION**: Catch disconnected features before production with comprehensive automated checks integrated into CI/CD.',

  scope: `**10-Week Automated Connectivity Testing Implementation**:

**PHASE 1: Route Coverage Testing (Weeks 1-2)**
├── Create route-coverage.test.ts validating all 10 pages
├── Check all app/*/page.tsx files are accessible via HTTP
├── Verify all 26 API routes return valid responses (not 404/500)
├── Build RouteInventory script scanning filesystem for routes
├── Compare discovered routes vs. registered routes (detect orphans)
├── Add to CI/CD pipeline: Fail build if new page has no route test
└── Target: 100% route coverage with automated verification

**PHASE 2: Navigation Path Validation (Weeks 3-4)**
├── Create navigation-paths.test.ts checking all nav links
├── Validate Navigation.tsx links match existing pages
├── Check sidebar items point to accessible routes
├── Detect dead links (links to non-existent pages)
├── Verify breadcrumb navigation correctness
├── Test deep linking (direct URL access works)
├── Add pre-commit hook: Block commits with broken nav links
└── Target: All navigation paths validated automatically

**PHASE 3: Orphaned Component Detection (Weeks 5-6)**
├── Build OrphanedComponentDetector analyzing import graphs
├── Scan all src/components/*.tsx for import references
├── Identify components with 0 imports (orphaned candidates)
├── Create allowlist for intentionally standalone components
├── Generate weekly report of orphaned components
├── Add CI/CD check: Alert on new orphaned components >30 days
├── Build component usage dashboard showing import counts
└── Target: Detect and alert on disconnected components

**PHASE 4: Import Reference Tracking (Weeks 7-8)**
├── Create ImportReferenceTracker using AST parsing
├── Build dependency graph showing component relationships
├── Track component usage trends over time (increasing/decreasing)
├── Identify "at-risk" components (usage declining for 3+ weeks)
├── Generate architectural insights (highly coupled components)
├── Add Slack alerts for critical component disconnections
├── Create ImportHealthScore metric (0-100) per component
└── Target: Proactive monitoring of component connectivity

**PHASE 5: Continuous Monitoring & Alerts (Weeks 9-10)**
├── Build ConnectivityMonitoringDashboard in EHG_Engineer app
├── Display real-time metrics: Route coverage %, broken links, orphaned components
├── Create automated daily reports (email to ops team)
├── Implement alert escalation (Slack → Email → PagerDuty)
├── Add GitHub Actions workflow for weekly connectivity audits
├── Create ConnectivityHealthReport generator (PDF export)
├── Build self-healing suggestions for common disconnections
├── Add regression protection: Lock in current connectivity baseline
└── Target: Zero feature disconnections with proactive alerts

**Quick Wins (Week 1)**:
• Route coverage test for 10 existing pages (8 hours)
• Navigation path validator in CI/CD (4 hours)
• Orphaned component detector script (6 hours)`,

  strategic_objectives: [
    'Create automated route coverage test suite validating all 10 Next.js pages and 26 API routes',
    'Build navigation path validator detecting broken links and dead navigation items',
    'Implement orphaned component detector scanning for unused React components',
    'Develop import reference tracker with AST parsing to map component dependencies',
    'Integrate all checks into CI/CD pipeline with fail-fast on disconnections',
    'Build connectivity monitoring dashboard showing real-time health metrics',
    'Create automated alerting system (Slack, Email, PagerDuty) for critical disconnections',
    'Generate daily/weekly connectivity reports with actionable insights',
    'Add pre-commit hooks to prevent broken navigation links from being committed',
    'Establish connectivity baseline and regression protection to lock in current health'
  ],

  success_criteria: [
    '✅ Route coverage test validates 100% of 10 pages and 26 API routes automatically',
    '✅ Navigation path validator runs in CI/CD, fails builds on broken links',
    '✅ Orphaned component detector identifies components with 0 imports weekly',
    '✅ Import reference tracker generates dependency graph for all components',
    '✅ CI/CD pipeline blocks PRs with new orphaned components or broken routes',
    '✅ Connectivity monitoring dashboard displays real-time metrics (route coverage %, orphan count, broken links)',
    '✅ Slack alerts fire within 5 minutes of critical disconnection (e.g., nav link to deleted page)',
    '✅ Daily connectivity report emailed to ops team with summary and action items',
    '✅ Pre-commit hook prevents commits with broken navigation paths',
    '✅ Connectivity health score ≥95% maintained (target: 100%)',
    '✅ Zero feature disconnections reach production after implementation',
    '✅ Component usage trends tracked over time, declining usage alerts trigger'
  ],

  key_principles: [
    '**Prevention over Remediation**: Catch disconnections before production, not after',
    '**Automated > Manual**: Zero reliance on manual checking or human memory',
    '**Fail Fast**: CI/CD must block bad code immediately, not allow merge',
    '**Proactive Alerts**: Predict issues before they become critical (declining usage trends)',
    '**Developer Experience**: Clear error messages with fix suggestions',
    '**Regression Protection**: Once connected, stay connected (baseline enforcement)',
    '**Visibility**: Dashboard and reports make connectivity health transparent',
    '**Continuous Improvement**: Learn from past disconnections, add new checks'
