  description: 'PDF export functionality for Chairman Dashboard. Deferred from SD-BACKEND-001 per user prioritization of EVA assistant features. High business value (8/10) and user demand (9/10), but user wants to focus on AI/voice capabilities first.',
  rationale: 'Deferred from SD-BACKEND-001 per user prioritization. User explicitly requested keeping EVA Voice features and deferring/cancelling PDF Export. While PDF has high business value (8/10) and user demand (9/10), user prioritizes EVA assistant (AI differentiation) over executive reporting features. Can be implemented after EVA Voice is complete.',

  scope: `**DEFERRED FEATURE: Chairman Export PDF**

**BUSINESS CONTEXT**:
- User Demand: 9/10 (VERY HIGH - executives need reports)
- Business Value: 8/10 (HIGH - critical executive workflow)
- Original Effort Estimate: 40-60h
- Deferred From: SD-BACKEND-001 (user scope revision)
- Deferred Date: 2025-10-03

**WHY DEFERRED**:
1. User prioritization: Focus on EVA assistant features first
2. AI differentiation takes precedence over reporting features
3. EVA Voice has user demand 8/10 and BV 9/10 (competitive requirement)
4. PDF Export can be implemented after EVA Voice is complete
5. User explicitly said "keep EVA, defer/cancel PDF"

**FEATURE DESCRIPTION**:
- Location: src/components/venture/ChairmanDashboard.tsx:189-202
- UI exists: "Export Report" button with download icon
- Backend: TODO comment "Implement Export Report functionality"
- User Experience: Click Export → nothing happens (needs to generate PDF)

**WHAT NEEDS TO BE BUILT**:

**Phase 1: PDF Generation Service (Week 1) - 20-30h**
1. Implement PDF generation service (Puppeteer for chart rendering)
2. Create report templates:
   - Executive summary (venture overview, key metrics)
   - KPIs (financial, operational, strategic)
   - Charts (render Recharts components server-side)
3. Build POST /api/dashboard/export endpoint
4. Add chart rendering pipeline (React SSR → HTML/CSS → PDF)
5. Implement download delivery (binary PDF, Content-Type: application/pdf)

**Phase 2: Quality & Performance (Week 2) - 10-15h**
6. Professional formatting (company logo, headers, footers, page numbers)
7. Multi-page support (auto page break for long reports)
8. Optimize generation speed (<5 seconds for standard report)
9. Handle large datasets (50+ charts, pagination)

**Phase 3: Testing & Deployment (Week 2) - 10-15h**
10. E2E testing (export → download → verify charts)
11. Performance testing (50 concurrent exports, <5s target)
12. Visual quality testing (charts match dashboard exactly)
13. Security testing (JWT authentication, rate limiting)
14. Production deployment
15. Remove TODO comment at ChairmanDashboard.tsx:189

**TOTAL EFFORT**: 40-60h

**USER STORY**:
As a chairman, I want to export the current dashboard view as PDF
So that I can include it in board presentations
Acceptance Criteria:
- Click "Export Report" → PDF generation starts (<5 seconds)
- PDF includes: Executive summary, KPIs, charts (rendered from Recharts)
- Professional formatting (company logo, page numbers, date)
- PDF downloads automatically (chairman-dashboard-2025-10-03.pdf)
- Charts match dashboard exactly (visual regression test)

**TECHNOLOGY STACK**:
- Backend: Puppeteer (headless Chrome for rendering)
- Rendering: React Server-Side Rendering (same components as dashboard)
- Output: Binary PDF (application/pdf), vector charts preferred
- Database: export_logs table (user_id, report_type, file_size, duration_ms)

**RE-EVALUATION TRIGGERS**:
1. EVA Voice feature is complete (SD-BACKEND-001 done)
2. Executive explicitly requests PDF export functionality
3. Competitive pressure (competitors emphasize reporting features)
4. Strategic initiative requires executive reporting enhancement

**DEPENDENCIES**:
- None (independent feature, can be implemented anytime)
- Recommended: Implement after SD-BACKEND-001 (EVA Voice) is complete

**WORKAROUND STATUS**:
- Current: Button doesn't work (executive frustration)
- Alternative: Screenshot dashboard manually (unprofessional)
- Best: Implement this feature when EVA Voice is done

**USER PRIORITIZATION**: Deferred in favor of EVA assistant features
**IMPLEMENTATION TIMING**: After SD-BACKEND-001 complete
