### Overview
**Mission-Critical Testing Automation** - Comprehensive E2E validation of all implementations against user stories.

**Philosophy**: **Do it right, not fast.** E2E testing is MANDATORY, not optional.

**Time Investment**: 30-60 minutes per SD for comprehensive E2E testing (saves 4-6 hours in rework)

### ü§ñ MCP Browser Automation (PREFERRED METHOD)

**‚ö° NEW: Claude Code MCP Servers Available** - Use these for ALL browser automation and testing tasks.

**Why MCP is Preferred**:
- **No manual setup**: MCP handles browser lifecycle automatically
- **Real-time interaction**: See the browser, interact manually if needed
- **Claude-driven**: Natural language commands drive browser actions
- **Screenshot automation**: Capture evidence without custom Playwright code
- **Faster feedback**: No test script writing - just describe what to test
- **Visual verification**: Human-in-the-loop validation for UI changes

#### Playwright MCP (Primary - RECOMMENDED)

**Best for**: Modern web apps, React/Vue/Vite applications, cross-browser testing

**Installation**: Already configured in Claude Code
\`\`\`bash
claude mcp list  # Verify "playwright" is connected
\`\`\`

**Usage Examples**:

**1. Basic Navigation & Screenshot**
\`\`\`
Use Playwright MCP to:
- Navigate to http://localhost:3000/chairman-analytics
- Wait for the page to load completely
- Take a screenshot and save as "chairman-analytics-before.png"
\`\`\`

**2. User Flow Testing**
\`\`\`
Use Playwright MCP to test the login flow:
1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000
2. Click the "Sign In" button
3. Fill email field with "test@example.com"
4. Fill password field with "password123"
5. Click "Submit"
6. Verify we're redirected to /dashboard
7. Take screenshot as evidence
\`\`\`

**3. Component Interaction**
\`\`\`
Use Playwright MCP to:
- Navigate to http://localhost:3000/settings
- Click the "Dark Mode" toggle
- Verify theme changes
- Take before/after screenshots
\`\`\`

**4. Form Validation Testing**
\`\`\`
Use Playwright MCP to test form validation:
- Navigate to http://localhost:3000/ventures/create
- Click "Submit" without filling required fields
- Verify error messages appear
- Fill all required fields
- Submit and verify success
\`\`\`

**5. E2E User Story Validation** (MANDATORY)
\`\`\`
Use Playwright MCP to validate US-001 (User can create new venture):
1. Navigate to /ventures
2. Click "New Venture" button
3. Fill venture name: "Test Venture"
4. Fill description: "Test Description"
5. Select category: "Technology"
6. Click "Create"
7. Verify venture appears in list
8. Take screenshot as evidence
\`\`\`

#### Puppeteer MCP (Alternative)

**Best for**: Simple screenshot tasks, Chrome-specific testing, legacy browser support

**Installation**: Already configured in Claude Code
\`\`\`bash
claude mcp list  # Verify "puppeteer" is connected
\`\`\`

**Usage Examples**:

**1. Quick Screenshot**
\`\`\`
Use Puppeteer MCP to:
- Open http://localhost:3000
- Take full-page screenshot
- Save as "dashboard-current-state.png"
\`\`\`

**2. Performance Measurement**
\`\`\`
Use Puppeteer MCP to:
- Navigate to http://localhost:3000/chairman-analytics
- Measure page load time
- Report metrics
\`\`\`

#### When to Use MCP vs Manual Playwright

**‚úÖ USE MCP (Preferred)**:
- Quick verification of UI changes (screenshot evidence for handoffs)
- Interactive testing during EXEC implementation
- Visual regression checks (before/after screenshots)
- Manual exploratory testing with automation assist
- User story validation with human verification
- Evidence collection for PRs and handoffs

**‚öôÔ∏è USE Manual Playwright Scripts**:
- Automated CI/CD test suites (npm run test:e2e)
- Regression test suites that run on every commit
- Comprehensive test coverage across all user stories
- Tests that need to run headless in GitHub Actions
- Performance benchmarking with consistent conditions

**üéØ RECOMMENDED WORKFLOW**:
1. **Development**: Use Playwright MCP for quick iteration and verification
2. **Pre-Handoff**: Use Playwright MCP to capture screenshot evidence
3. **Verification**: Run manual Playwright suite (npm run test:e2e) for comprehensive validation
4. **CI/CD**: Automated Playwright runs in GitHub Actions on every push

### Lessons from Repository (Database + Prior Conversations):

**‚úÖ Success Patterns**:
1. **Dev mode over preview mode** (SD-AGENT-ADMIN-002): Dev mode (port 5173) provides faster feedback and more reliable E2E testing than preview mode (port 4173). Preview can cause blank page renders.
2. **Auto-triggers prevent oversight** (SD-AGENT-ADMIN-002): QA Engineering Director auto-triggers eliminate human error in test execution
3. **Playwright-managed dev servers** (SD-AGENT-MIGRATION-001): Let Playwright manage server lifecycle via webServer config (reuseExistingServer: true)
4. **RLS testing framework** (0d5f1ecc): Automated security verification with anon key testing

**‚ùå Failure Patterns**:
1. **Deferred testing = unknown runtime behavior** (ccf6484d): Testing must happen during EXEC phase, not after
2. **Ambiguous "smoke tests"** (SD-AGENT-ADMIN-002): Allowed E2E-only execution when unit tests also required
3. **Script vs manual mismatch** (SD-AGENT-ADMIN-002): QA script reported failures when manual tests passed (env configuration issue)

**üîß Improvement Areas** (From Retrospectives):
1. Dev mode vs preview mode decision matrix (SD-AGENT-ADMIN-002)
2. Dual test execution enforcement: unit + E2E (SD-AGENT-ADMIN-002)
3. Testing tier framework/command specificity (SD-AGENT-ADMIN-002)
4. Testing section in retrospective template (SD-EXPORT-001)
5. Runtime testing during EXEC (ccf6484d)
6. Test environment pre-flight validation (SD-AGENT-ADMIN-002)

### Core Capabilities

1. **MCP Browser Automation** (**NEW - PREFERRED**)
   - Playwright MCP for modern web app testing
   - Puppeteer MCP for quick screenshots and Chrome testing
   - Natural language browser control via Claude Code
   - Real-time visual verification with human-in-the-loop
   - Automatic screenshot capture for evidence collection
   - Interactive testing during EXEC implementation

2. **Professional Test Case Generation from User Stories**
   - Queries \`user_stories\` table for SD requirements
   - Creates comprehensive Given-When-Then test scenarios
   - Maps each user story to ‚â•1 E2E test case
   - Generates Playwright test suites with proper selectors
   - Documents test coverage percentage

3. **Pre-test Build Validation** (saves 2-3 hours)
   - Validates build before testing
   - Parses build errors and provides fix recommendations
   - Blocks test execution if build fails

4. **Database Migration Verification** (prevents 1-2 hours debugging)
   - Checks if migrations are applied before testing
   - Identifies pending migrations by SD ID
   - Provides automated and manual execution options

5. **Component Integration Checking** (saves 30-60 minutes)
   - Verifies components are actually imported and used
   - Detects "built but not integrated" gaps
   - Prevents unused code accumulation

6. **Mandatory E2E Test Tier**
   - Tier 1 (Smoke): Basic sanity checks (3-5 tests, <60s) - NOT sufficient alone
   - **Tier 2 (E2E via Playwright): MANDATORY** (10-30 tests, <10min) - **REQUIRED FOR APPROVAL**
   - Tier 3 (Manual): Only for complex edge cases (rare)
   - **Standard**: Smoke tests check "does it load?", E2E tests prove "does it work?"

7. **Playwright E2E Test Execution** (MANDATORY)
   - Automated browser testing for all user journeys
   - Screenshot capture for visual evidence
   - Video recording on failures for debugging
   - HTML reports with pass/fail status
   - Test evidence stored in \`tests/e2e/evidence/SD-XXX/\`

8. **Test Infrastructure Discovery** (saves 30-60 minutes)
   - Discovers existing auth helpers, test fixtures
   - Recommends reuse of authenticateUser() and other helpers
   - Prevents recreation of existing infrastructure

9. **Cross-SD Dependency Detection** (saves 10-15 minutes)
   - Identifies conflicts with in-progress SDs
   - Analyzes import statements for dependencies
   - Provides risk assessment and recommendations

10. **Automated Migration Execution** (saves 5-8 minutes)
    - Uses supabase link + supabase db push
    - Auto-applies pending migrations
    - Validates migration files before execution

11. **Testing Learnings for Continuous Improvement**
    - Captures testing effectiveness after each SD
    - Documents what worked, what didn't with Playwright
    - Identifies test infrastructure improvements needed
    - Feeds retrospective for sub-agent enhancement
    - Tracks evolution: v2.0 ‚Üí v2.5 (automated generation) ‚Üí v3.0 (AI-assisted + self-healing)

### 5-Phase Execution Workflow

**Phase 1: Pre-flight Checks**
- Build validation
- Database migration verification
- Cross-SD dependency check
- Component integration check (if UI SD)
- **MCP server availability check** (**NEW**)
- **Dev server availability** (check port 5173 or 8080)

**Phase 2: Professional Test Case Generation** (MANDATORY)
- Query \`user_stories\` table for SD
- For each user story, create Given-When-Then test scenarios
- Generate Playwright test files with proper test IDs
- **Prepare MCP test commands** for interactive validation (**NEW**)
- Define test data requirements and fixtures
- Map user stories to test coverage (must be 100%)

**Phase 3: E2E Test Execution** (MANDATORY, NOT CONDITIONAL)
- **Option A: MCP Interactive Testing** (PREFERRED for EXEC phase) (**NEW**)
  - Use Playwright MCP for real-time user story validation
  - Capture screenshots for each user story acceptance criteria
  - Human verification of UI/UX correctness
  - Evidence collection for handoff deliverables
- **Option B: Automated Playwright Suite** (REQUIRED for CI/CD)
  - Execute Playwright E2E tests (ALL user stories)
  - Capture screenshots on success
  - Capture videos on failures
  - Generate HTML test reports
- Store evidence in database

**Phase 4: Evidence Collection**
- Screenshots proving features work (MCP or automated)
- Test execution logs
- Playwright HTML reports
- Coverage metrics (user story validation %)
- Test infrastructure notes

**Phase 5: Verdict & Testing Learnings**
- Aggregate all results
- Calculate final verdict: PASS / CONDITIONAL_PASS / BLOCKED
- Generate recommendations for PLAN
- Document testing learnings for retrospective
- Store in \`sub_agent_execution_results\` table with testing_learnings field

### Success Criteria

**PASS Verdict** requires:
- ‚úÖ Build successful (or skipped)
- ‚úÖ All migrations applied
- ‚úÖ **ALL E2E tests pass (100% user stories validated)** (MANDATORY)
- ‚úÖ Test evidence collected (MCP screenshots AND/OR Playwright report)
- ‚úÖ No critical integration gaps

**CONDITIONAL_PASS** if:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è E2E tests pass but minor issues in edge cases
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Non-critical integration warnings
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Test infrastructure improvements identified but not blocking

**BLOCKED** if:
- ‚ùå Build fails
- ‚ùå Pending migrations not applied
- ‚ùå **ANY E2E test failures** (user stories not validated)
- ‚ùå Critical dependency conflicts

### Dev Mode vs Preview Mode (From Repository Lessons)

**Default: Dev Mode (Port 5173)**
- Faster feedback loop
- More reliable component rendering
- No production optimizations interfering with tests
- Hot reload for debugging

**When to Use Preview Mode (Port 4173)**:
- Final pre-release validation only
- Performance benchmarking
- Testing production bundle sizes

**Known Issue** (SD-AGENT-ADMIN-002): Preview mode can cause blank page renders in E2E tests. Always default to dev mode.
