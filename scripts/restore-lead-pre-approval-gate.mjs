Once SD is approved, LEAD commits to full scope and verifies completion only - scope reduction post-approval is prohibited without explicit human authorization and creating new SDs for deferred work.
- **üõ°Ô∏è HUMAN APPROVAL REQUIRED**: LEAD MUST request human approval before changing SD status/priority. Use standardized over-engineering rubric for evaluations. NEVER override user selections without explicit permission.
- **üìã Over-Engineering Evaluation**: Use \`scripts/lead-over-engineering-rubric.js\` for standardized assessments. Present findings to human for approval before any changes.
- **üö´ PROHIBITED**: Autonomous SD status changes, user selection overrides, subjective over-engineering calls without rubric. **ü§ñ MANDATORY SUB-AGENT AUTOMATION**: Before approving any SD as complete, LEAD MUST run . This automatically executes all required sub-agents (Continuous Improvement Coach for retrospectives, DevOps Platform Architect for CI/CD verification) and validates completion requirements. Failure to run this script will result in missed retrospectives and incomplete protocol execution. **‚úÖ APPROVAL CHECKLIST**: LEAD may only approve an SD after: (1) Running  successfully, (2) Verifying output shows "‚úÖ SD READY FOR COMPLETION", (3) Reviewing any warnings, (4) Obtaining human approval for status change.`;

### MANDATORY Before Approving ANY Strategic Directive

LEAD MUST answer these questions BEFORE approval:

1. **Need Validation**: Is this solving a real user problem or perceived problem?
2. **Simplicity Check**: What's the simplest solution that delivers core value?
3. **Existing Tools**: Can we configure existing tools instead of building new?
4. **80/20 Analysis**: Can we deliver 80% value with 20% of proposed effort?
5. **Scope Reduction**: Should this be split into multiple smaller SDs?
6. **Phase Decomposition**: Can we defer Phase 3-4 features to separate SD?

**If answers suggest over-engineering ‚Üí LEAD MUST**:
- Reduce scope BEFORE approval
- Create separate SDs for deferred work
- Document rationale for scope changes
- Get human approval for major reductions

**SCOPE LOCK**: Once LEAD approves an SD, the scope is LOCKED. LEAD may NOT:
- ‚ùå Re-evaluate "do we really need this?" during final approval
- ‚ùå Apply simplicity filter after EXEC phase begins
- ‚ùå Defer work unilaterally during verification
- ‚ùå Mark SD complete if PRD requirements not met

**Exception**: LEAD may reduce scope mid-execution ONLY if:
1. Critical technical blocker discovered (impossibility)
2. External business priorities changed dramatically
3. Explicit human approval obtained
4. New SD created for all deferred work
