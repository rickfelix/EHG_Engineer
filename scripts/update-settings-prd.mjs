  executive_summary: `Comprehensive 5-phase enhancement of the user settings route focusing on navigation improvements, accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA), component refactoring, and user experience optimization. 

**Current Issues Identified**:
- SystemConfiguration.tsx (790 LOC) exceeds optimal component size (target: 300-600 LOC)
- NotificationSettings.tsx is a 4-line placeholder requiring full implementation
- Design Sub-Agent identified: 90 design system violations, 33 accessibility issues, 470 design inconsistencies
- 6 components exceed 600 LOC threshold

**Approved Scope**: 70-95 hours across 5 phases (user-approved full scope despite SIMPLICITY FIRST concerns)`,

  business_context: `Settings are critical for user customization and control. Poor settings UX leads to support tickets and user frustration. Navigation clarity directly impacts user satisfaction. Bugs in settings can block users from configuring their account.`,

  technical_context: `**Existing Infrastructure**:
- Clean tab-based UI with Shadcn components (89 LOC main page)
- 6 functional tabs: Profile, System, Language, Notifications, Security, Navigation
- Total infrastructure: 3,045 LOC across components
- Route: /settings
- Stack: React + TypeScript + Shadcn UI + Tailwind CSS

**Target Application**: EHG (/mnt/c/_EHG/ehg/) - Customer-facing business application`,

  implementation_approach: `**5-Phase Implementation Strategy**:

**PHASE 1: Assessment & Discovery (10-15h - Week 1)**
1. Comprehensive audit of existing settings route
2. Document current navigation structure and layout
3. Catalog all functional and visual bugs identified by Design Sub-Agent
4. Review analytics and create prioritized improvement backlog

**PHASE 2: Component Architecture & Refactoring (15-20h - Week 2)**
5. Split SystemConfiguration.tsx into focused components:
   - GeneralSettings.tsx (300-400 LOC)
   - DatabaseSettings.tsx (250-350 LOC)
   - SecuritySettings.tsx (existing, may need refactor if >600 LOC)
   - IntegrationSettings.tsx (300-400 LOC)
6. Implement NotificationSettings.tsx (400-500 LOC)
7. Ensure 300-600 LOC per component
8. Apply Shadcn UI design system consistently

**PHASE 3: Accessibility & UX Improvements (20-25h - Week 3)**
9. Fix all 33 accessibility issues (WCAG 2.1 AA)
10. Add ARIA labels, alt text, semantic HTML
11. Implement keyboard navigation with focus management
12. Add auto-save functionality
13. Enhanced form validation with clear error messages
14. Loading states and visual feedback

**PHASE 4: Bug Fixes & Design Compliance (15-20h - Week 4)**
15. Fix 90 design system violations
16. Replace inline styles with Tailwind classes
17. Fix 470 design inconsistencies
18. Add error boundaries and graceful error handling
19. Polish animations and micro-interactions
20. Performance optimization (lazy loading, code splitting)

**PHASE 5: Testing & Documentation (10-15h - Week 5)**
21. E2E testing for all settings workflows (Playwright)
22. Accessibility testing (axe, WAVE)
23. Cross-browser testing
24. Mobile device testing
25. Performance testing (Lighthouse)
26. User documentation and changelog

**Component Architecture**: Target 300-600 LOC per component, leverage existing Shadcn UI components, maintain existing tab structure`,
